PartyLink,https://hackcuv.devpost.com/submissions/113493-partylink,"Inspiration

Party Registration at college campuses right now is a tedious process, students are required to physically go to some department just so they can register their party which is why most students don't do it. We wanted to create an app that solves this, students can verify their status using their .edu emails at their campuses to prove that they're students. 

There is also no standard protocol for party registration at campuses since each campus requires different things from their students, by asking student for the same information (name,address of party,etc..) we make this application very scalable. 

What It Does

Students use this to register their parties, college campuses can use this to keep track of all the parties occurring and to ensure everyone's safety. Other students can also find registered parties and RSVP.

How We Built It

Our team used NodeJS.Ngrok (server side) as well as Javascript as the primary language, we used HTML/CSS to create the front end and we integrated the Typeform API into our project.

Challenges We Ran Into


Linking mongoDB with typeform
Retrieving data from our databases and displaying it on our HTML Page.
Restricting features we wanted to add due to the time constraint


Accomplishments That We Are Proud Of


Successfully logging data into our database using typeforms
Hosting our HTML pages and having them redirect properly
Implementing a minimalist design to keep the user experience simple and to the point
Working as a team to solve issues


What We Learned


Greater understanding of databases
Additional experience in HTML/CSS, Javascript, NodeJS, and React


What's Next For PartyLink

Has potential to include APIs for some features. We originally wanted to include a map pin pointing all on/off campus student parties and also to add Snapchat Bitmoji integration but time was limited. There is also lots of room to expand communications with users of the application and their Universities.

CreateHUB,https://hackcuv.devpost.com/submissions/113508-createhub,"GitHub: https://github.com/vitr2218/HackCUProject

Inspiration

Connect and Create: 
Out there is a programmer who develops games in their free time, an artist who is an avid gamer, and a composer-producer who has always wanted to work on a game. Or a singer who wants art and video to go with their original song. Or someone who wants to construct a campaign complete with visuals to help illustrate their worthy cause. CreateHUB intends to bring together these creators and connect them on like-minded projects in both the amateur and professional scenes. 

The way creators currently come together involves investing time and interaction on sites such as Twitter, Instagram, ArtStation, SoundCloud, GitHub and a dose of luck in discovering a fellow creative who fits into their dream project. Even then, it is difficult to know whether or not someone would be willing and available to take on a project. CreateHUB's motivation is to cultivate a centralized space for singers, artists, programmers, video editors, composers, creators from all tracks to collaborate on projects like music, comics, videos, and games.

What it does

Provides a way for creators to explore potential projects in the marketplace and display a portfolio. Users can sign up using Typeform.

How we built it

HTML/CSS, Javascript, Typeform (signup), Firebase as the database for user data and host for the web app, Node.js packages, Express, AngularJS

Challenges we ran into

We were unfamiliar with using Typeform and Firebase so everything was a learning experience. Also, agreeing on an idea was difficult and time consuming.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

Building something and working with tools we've never used before. We're proud that we were able to pass data between Typeform on the website and Firebase. We really pushed ourselves by learning new things instead of sticking to what we already know.

What we learned

Firebase, Typeform, HTML/CSS/Javascript hacks, AngularJS

What's next for CreateHUB

World takeover.

Distributed Multi User Dungeon,https://hackcuv.devpost.com/submissions/113510-distributed-multi-user-dungeon,"Inspiration

What it does

DMUD is a way to run any multi user text-based adventure including user made adventures. It supports any device including mobile, SMS, web, and desktop. DMUD is decentralized and uses the interplanetary filesystem (IPFS) to store data, rather than storing it on a central server. DMUD is a peer-to-peer system, again requiring no central server, little setup, and no specific network requirements.

How we built it

DMUD is built with Python. It uses the Twilio SMS API to connect players via text message and uses the Python IPFS bindings to store data in YAML format on the IPFS. 

Challenges we ran into

We learned that peer-to-peer libraries are finicky and require a specific network setup that we don't have access to at a hackathon. We also learned a lot about the pitfalls of object oriented design, especially with complex object interactions.

What's next for Distributed Multi User Dungeon

We would like to implement a more robust connection mechanism and improve the user interface.

KRYPTIA,https://hackcuv.devpost.com/submissions/113512-kryptia,"Summary

KRYPTIA is a multiplayer competitive educational game for Android or IOS in which participants challenge each other to prove who is the one able to decipher hidden words quicker. The game allows the player to compete in Challenging Duels (1 vs 1) or participate in Grand Challenges (All vs All). This last one has an ���Educational Challenge�۝, which allows a teacher to take control of a Grand Challenge mode, making children from the same class or school compete with each other under their teacher�۪s supervision. This works as a tool that empowers teachers  that want to introduce cybersecurity and cyphration to children in a fun and proactive way.

Game Objective

The objective of the game is to get the higher\st amount of points. When in a game, KRYPTIA will show the same 10 different questions to the users that are competing. Depending on the time needed to correctly answer each question, the times that you answered them wrong, and the position respect other users to answer each question, users will get more points. After everybody has answered all questions, points are displayed and winner (a podium of 3) is declared.

Storyline

You are a interstellar traveller in a world where something called Earth is the last turistic call. But there is a problem: as people from all over the galaxy gather there, nobody understands anybody. So, in order to understand what they are saying from this extremely interesting place called ���Earth�۝, you need to decipher what they are saying! Gather some friends to join you in this planet, and try to find out who is the quicker decypher.

Learning Objectives

User Centered Objectives


Motivate children to independently learn basic encrypting skills
Teach children about US cybersecurity current situation and challenges.
Help teachers to teach basic mathematical conversions (alphabet, decimal, binary, hexadecimal) in a participative and enjoyable way.
Provide tools to teachers that want to rise cybersecurity awareness to their pupils.


Skills Learned by Users


Ability to make critical observations.
Extract important information and patterns.
Understand the basic cyphration techniques
Capability to solve abstract problems.


Challenges Structures

The users, during the game, will have to solve 10 ���challenges�۝. Each challenge is a question that has to be answered. These questions fall in three different categories.


Category 1: determined before starting the match, sets the topic of the questions.
-- Examples: Food facts; Countries facts; Cybersecurity facts.
Category 2: determines if what has been coded is a sentence or a number. The solution to the sentence type will be a word. The solution to number types will be a number.
-- Examples Sentences: Uif dpmps pg uif topx? (The color of the snow?) Answer: White.
-- Examples Numbers: In 2040 (1939) started WWII. Answer: 1939.
Category 3:determines how the question is coded.


Game Flow

You load into the game with your username and your password.
When loaded, you can change your avatar.
In the main menu you can see:
    Start a new Game
    Enter a started game
    Continue playing a game you had already started
    See the progress in a game you have finished playing, but need to wait for other players
    See your stats.

When you start a new game, you can set three different game modes:


Duel Challenge: In this game mode you play a quick match of a random topic against a friend.
Kryptia Storm: In this game mode there is one person that designs one challenge and the other people join the room (up to 10 people). Then, asynchronously, people complete the 10 questions on the topic. The one with more points win.
Grand Challenge: (class mode) in this last game mode, the teacher can control all aspects of the challenge Controlling the 3 categories of each question, and even making its own ones! The point is that on that class they would have been taught how to solve it and the reward could be either a class ranking or the ones who finish can go to the playground so the faster you solve the challenge the more play time you get.


Scoring


500 points - 1 point per second left
100 points if you are first
80 points if you are second
60 points if you are third
-20 points if you are wrong
Maxim total points: 6000

MIXBOY Advance,https://hackcuv.devpost.com/submissions/113533-mixboy-advance,"To get the clearest idea of what this is, skip the reading and just watch this demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmD76k6nBVs&feature=youtu.be

Inspiration

Perhaps the most iconic instrument in contemporary music ��� especially hip-hop ��� is the sampler/sequencer (here's one of my favorite videos about how some beautiful music came from it https://youtu.be/SENzTt3ftiU). In short; it's an instrument that takes any sample of audio ��� speech, music, drums ��� chops it into 16 to 32 discrete sounds, and then lets you play those sounds as though they were notes on a keyboard. It also lets you sequence/save what you play; when you record, it determines where in a 32-bar sequence an individual note you played should go, and then it plays back that sequence later on.

It costs in the four figures, though; we wanted to build something similar that'd work out of your browser, would be compatible with even the cheapest (starting at $20) controller/pad/keyboard, and would be easy for kids & adults to use. To that end, we built it with React.js, and for the audio input we take in and chop any YouTube URL.

What it does

Our tool does exactly what we described the iconic MPC sampler/sequencer does; it lets you take in any audio input (via YouTube), chops it into 24 discrete sounds, and lets you play those sounds and sequence/save them. Once you're recorded your playing (and it sequences what you've made), your URL automatically becomes share-able so that you can share your creation with anyone!

How we built it

Lot's of React, a WebMIDI library, convoluted sequencer logic, lots of tacky nostalgic CSS and GIFs :)

Challenges we ran into

The logic behind writing a sequencer is actually kinda complicated, and it took us a while to wrap our heads around. We also attempted making this a multi-track instrument, but keeping time synchronized in JavaScript is challenging enough that we decided to defer that to after the hackathon.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

It's hard to build a sequencer! We built one. We turned a several hundred/thousand dollar instrument into one that is now accessible to anyone with a laptop and maybe $20. We made an instrument inspired by what the pros use, but that's accessible to even a 4-year old who just wants to make a Baby Shark remix.

What's next for MIXBOY Advance

Turning it into a full-fledged multi-track sequencer instead of just one sample one track. Figuring out better ways to process the audio. Putting it in front of kids to see what kinds of creative stuff they can come up with.

CyberHack (Demo),https://hackcuv.devpost.com/submissions/113580-cyberhack-demo,"Inspiration

The inspiration for this game primarily came from the series called ""Welcome To The Game."" These games had a unique way of implementing elements of computer science and programming into the mechanics of the game through randomly generated minigames in real time. The source of inspiration for the multiple choice section came from basic trivia style video games.

What it does

The basic rundown of the program starts with the reading functions that implement all the necessary variables to run the game and trivia from txt.files. This is run in the background and the user will not notice unless a txt.file is missing or corrupted. 
Then it displays the first menu options: Start a new game, Continue from a save file, Read the rules, or quit. The program is able to handle both starting from a new game and reading saved data from a save file and continuing from that savepoint. 
If you select a new game, you can select the difficulty, which determines the number of rounds to play. For each round, the game randomly selects a minigame and pulls a question from the database. 
Minigame one is Programmer, where the user is asked to type in the displayed code as shown and is rewarded points for full accuracy. Minigame two is Pop Quiz, which asks multiple choice questions on basic cybersecurity concepts.

How I built it

Every program starts with a concept, outline, and/or pseudocode. I start with determining what are the end goals of the program and what variables are needed throughout the function. Since I wanted to develop the functions for reading and writing save files, I had to design multiple functions and an organized system to handle and store the necessary variables to be accessed or changed at any time. Then, I started with the implementation of a class to organize and run all the functions and the driver to start the game running process. Afterward, I slowly worked each function associated with a different section of the game mechanics and rigorously tested every new function before proceeding to the next.

Challenges I ran into

I had 3 main challenges to overcome during the project.
The first was both using the getline functions to read in the data from the txt.files correctly. I'm not sure how it's possible to get a stoi error from a getline function, but I did that unintentionally, multiple times. Even when getline was working, then I had issues afterward storing the data in the right locations.

The second was linked list implementation for the data of multiple choice minigame. It was either a linked list or some form of a 3D array, which I can only assume would cause more disasters than I experienced with the linked list. It was primarily syntax and segfaults errors when trying to access the data from the linked lists that ultimately lead to a restructure of the minigame functions.

The last problem was my getter and setter functions for the minigame questions. The intention of these functions was to store the question string or it's index number after it was already answered as a way of avoiding duplicates in the same game. Despite my best efforts and multiple versions of these functions, if you play the game enough times, every now then you'll still see a duplicate question in the same playthrough. It occurs with a higher chance when the player continues from a saved file.

Accomplishments that I'm proud of

Despite some minor imperfections, I'm proud that I achieved creating a working demo of a game I designed on a solo team. I'm happy with the organization and planning that went into it so that my time could be more focused on troubleshooting and debugging.

What I learned

While ambition is great, I learned to not be too ambitious and know my limitations. There were ideas for more minigames, a surplus of trivia questions, even implementing some version of a real-time coding section where the player had to code the displayed text within a certain frame of time. Time was most certainly the biggest factor and at times, while I would have liked to program more complex functions and game mechanics, I did have to settle for simplicity for the sake of moving forward and finishing a working demo. Lastly, a couple last minor lessons were converting integers into strings and re-learning how to cin a string that counts spaces. 

What's next for CyberHack (Demo)

Well, the first step would be to look back at those getter and setter functions for the minigame questions and work out a new solution that fixes the issues mentioned above. Afterward, I would consider what other minigames I can implement that kids would enjoy while also educating them on cybersecurity. Lastly, I would most likely modify this code to run into some sort of game engine or user interface program to make it visually appealing as opposing to just staring text in a terminal screen the whole time. I've been told by a friend that the Unreal Engine runs on C++, so that's worth investigating for future projects.

MLocation,https://hackcuv.devpost.com/submissions/113587-mlocation,"Inspiration

Our primary inspiration was the benefits this kind of technology could have on the general public. One benefit is for those who lose their technology very often. For example, the loss of a laptop or phone can be debilitating, especially in today's society. However, by using a network of interconnected nodes, we can find a registered device with ease.

What it does

Determines the precise location of a MAC address identified device by determining its distance from 3 or more locating devices (similar function to antennae).

How we built it

Using the monitor mode of network interfaces, we were able to determine the signal strength between devices in the area and an ""antenna"". After finding the strength for each device, we found the distance this signal strength correlated with. Using our triangulation algorithm, we were able to then pinpoint the exact location of the device, considering the placement of our ""antennae"". We then uploaded this data to our Google Cloud Platform (GCP) server and displayed the devices in a birds-eye view of the current room.

Challenges we ran into

Perhaps the biggest challenge we ran into was with our original idea. We originally planned to have a Raspberry Pi function as an antenna, decreasing the size and increasing the simplicity of our design. However, we learned much later that the WiFi adapters we planned on using would not support this kind of functionality and that we would have to scrap the idea for our own computers with much more supported internet cards.

What we learned

We learned that USB WiFi adapters are no substitute for the internal WiFi cards already enclosed within our other computers.

What's next for MLocation

We plan on using WiFi adapters that are supported with Raspberry Pis as well as implement other methods of determining a location (such as angle of arrival, time of arrival, and channel state information) in the future in order to fulfill our original vision.

Food Lord,https://hackcuv.devpost.com/submissions/113619-food-lord,"Inspiration

Have you ever thought about what are you really eating? Maybe no. Are you too lazy for counting calories and for monitoring if you exceed the limit? Maybe yes. Here is where Food Lord borns. An application that allows you to take a picture and automagically know what are you gonna eat!

What it does

Our web app allows you to estimate how many calories and which ingredients there are in the picture that you sent to the application. In order to do that, you only have to create an account and then take a picture or upload an image.

We know that this magic process could have bad results or ingredients that there aren't in the given image. In order to solve that, we've added a feature that allows you to add and remove ingredients to the processed image.

Finally, the app will save this data (known as a report) and they will be available to check in the user dashboard, where you can have a quick look about how you have been eating during the current week.

How we built it

Frontend and backend are very different components connected by API requests.

At frontend, we can see a React application that uses the library Grommet in order to use the UI components and integrated into a Docker compose.

In the other side of the application, we have the backend which is implemented with Python 3.6+. For creating the API that allows the communication between the two components, we have used Flask and OpenAPI (connected themselves with Connexion library), also integrated with Docker compose.

The core of the application, which allows us to estimate the calories and ingredients of a given image, has been possible thanks to RapidAPI. Food Lord is using these three APIs:


Imagga: this API allows us to use a Computer vision segmentation model for tagging all the objects that we get from the image. We also filter these tags using a threshold of 0.35 (35%).
Recipe: this API allows for getting all the ingredients from a huge database. This permits us to filter the results that we got from Imagga Image Recognition API.
Nutritionix: this API allows us to get all the information related to calories. Given a list of ingredients, we can get an estimation of how many calories have those ingredients.


This aggregation of APIs (called Food Lord API) has been deployed and exposed in the RapidAPI Marketplace, where you can test with an Internet-accessible image URL.

All this system is finally deployed in a Google Cloud VM and hosted in a free .tk domain.

Challenges we ran into

Since we have never used the kind of technology we needed to do a deep research in order to find the APIs to use with RapidAPI. Also we have found some problems when we were coding the fronted because we used a new library for us ��� Grommet components.

However, the most challenging part was deploying the web in Google Cloud Platform since a lot of ports of the Wi-Fi were blocked.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud of the project that we built. We have developed all the web app faster than we actually expected so we can take special care of a good UX experience and reach the objectives that we have.

What we learned

We learned a lot using the RapidAPI and discovering the huge amount of APIs that we have at our disposal. Also, regarding the front-end part, we learned a lot using Grommet, which is a React library.

What's next for Food Lord

There are a lot of enhancements and next steps that Food Lord could have. But, for example, could be interesting to share the meals and their estimations with the user dietist so he/she could help the user to be even healthier.

We wanted to make a tool to help people learn about Cybersecurity Capture the Flag challenges and how to go about solving a few basic and fun ones! We also wanted to set up a way to host CTF competitions through the CU Cybersecurity Club and get more people involved in this amazing field. CTFHero creates a platform with a huge potential to help people who are just starting, as well as veterans,  learn and grow their skills in cybersecurity.

So go check it out! See what the hype is about and why cybersecurity is the next big thing!

We used Google Cloud to host the web server and manage the CTF sub-pages and a Domain.com domain to host the site. A Redis database houses the past challenges and the plan is to extend it to pull directly from ctftime.org for writeups from future competitions. We all improved our web development skills and learned more about Node.js and how it integrates inside a website. The plan is also to use the ""Compete"" section to run future CTFs for the CU Cybersecurity Club.

Whoever has looked for them has disappeared too, because they couldn�۪t solve the enigma. 3 years after their disappearance, detective Schmidt from Nebraska agreed to work on the case voluntarily, not just because nobody had been able to solve the enigma, but because of the scary accounts told by other detectives. He finds clues in the house to find the lost rooms, until he gets to...

How we built it

Mahshab created the storyline. Mahshab and Ghazaleh created the graphics in Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator, from scratch. Ghazaleh, Sepideh and Maziyar worked on the Front End. Sepideh and Maziyar worked on the Backend and Cybersecurity questions.

Challenges we ran into

Dealing with flask; Animating page elements using Javascript; Connecting the story behind the pictures with the cybersecurity questions asked.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

Good story, good graphics, making it all work! 

What we learned

We learned it's a challenging task to design for K-12, or in general, for people not in your generation.
We learned animating the page elements with JavaScript. We were challenged by and learned how to deal with flask and use python in it. 

What's next for Enigma

Implementing the rest of story (which is so interesting, but 24 hours was too short for its implementation).

Firewall Fighter,https://hackcuv.devpost.com/submissions/113758-firewall-fighter,"Inspiration

The idea of teaching kids about cybersecurity at an early age got us thinking about when we first learned about anything related to cybersecurity. Among our earliest memories included learning about firewalls, but the way we were taught about it was both uninteresting and inaccurate in hindsight. The teacher would simply put an inaccurate diagram on the board and inform us that it ""blocked most of the traffic from our computers."" We felt that this model did not properly represent the amount of parsing and work a firewall must perform, and there must be a better way to teach students about this concept.

What it does

The player controls a small ball on screen with a leap motion. Traffic (red and green cubes) enter the top of the screen and exit through the bottom. The player must direct their ball into the red malicious cubes to prevent them from entering our network while allowing as many green cubes as possible to pass through. Sounds were added so that hitting a cube feels more like a real world action. The game also gets progressively harder as the game goes on as more cubes fall in the same time period.

How we built it

We used the leap motion detect and translate hand motions into an in-game action of moving a sphere around. The sphere is simply mapped to the movements of the palm of the right hand. This sphere is then used as the ""mouse"" on screen for the user. We then used simple unity c# scripts and objects to create the cubes that fall down the screen,  instructions, and a score.

Challenges we ran into

From the onset, we had a steep learning curve to learn C# and Unity which neither of us had used before. We managed to figure them both out pretty well, but we struggled to properly detect collisions between the hand object the leap automatically creates and other objects we create. In order to resolve this problem, we had to create a sphere that followed the hand around. Then, we could use this sphere to detect collisions with other objects. This made the coding much easier, but also made the controls easier too. The user does not have to see and try to comprehend a whole hand on the screen, they can simply just move one little ball around.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

We created a working prototype of the game we envisioned in the beginning.  We're also proud the game feels somewhat natural and fun to play.

What we learned

We taught ourselves how to use three new things (leap motion, Unity, c#).

What's next for Firewall Fighter

Our game could have a bit more explanation of the cyber-security principles.

DebateMonkey,https://hackcuv.devpost.com/submissions/113779-debatemonkey,"Inspiration

I participated in debate in high school and still go back and judge tournaments and coach the students. I realized that the process of managing the tournament, most notably scheduling rounds, notifying competitors and maintaining results, was done in a very inefficient manner, mostly by hand. An online service does exist to provide this service, tabroom.com, but it does not have an extensive feature set, and its service is unreliable. Thats why we decided to make debate monkey, a tool to provide these service rapidly and reliably.

What it does

DebateMonkey is web service in which tournament officials can create tournaments so that students can join on their own accord. Once a tournament is created, any user with access can register for the tournament. DebateMonkey will automatically create matches and notify the students as to where their round is and who they are facing. It will also assign to judge to critique the round. Afterwards, the judge can enter their decision and comments to each team. After the judge submits this electronic ballot, DebateMonkey will automatically tabulate these matches to create finals qualifiers and overall placements. At the official's behest, the judges comments may be hidden or revealed to the competitors at whatever point. All of this functionality is available through the web interface or the app. If any students opt out of they app, they may also chose to receive notifications via SMS, using Twilio.

How I built it

The web frontend was built in ReactJS. The backend is a RESTful Django Framework, that manages a mySQL database to store all tournaments, users, and round results. The back end is responsible for tabulating the results and pushing notifications via Twilio or the App. The app was built using Flutter.

Challenges I ran into

Originally, we were a team of 4, but all of my team was forced to leave early in the HackCU tournament, leaving only me to work on the project. This resulted in this projected being far too large scale for a single person to handle. I decided to drop the app and focus mostly on the web interface. Also, I didn't have much time to focus on the styling and UX and had to focus on functionality leaving the site a little rough around the edges. The hardest technical challenges were serializing the many to many relationship with users and tournaments in the database using Django models and maintaining persistent login sessions utilizing authorization tokens. 

Accomplishments that I'm proud of

I managed to get a relatively functional site that encompasses the basic functionalities of my desired app while only having one person. The end product is still visually appealing and the UI is fairly intuitive. The Twilio API was successfully implemented and sends out a text message to a registered user.

What I learned

The technology I learned most about was Django and how to manage database models with it. I also learned how to implement the Twilio API, and also how to stay sane after 24 hours of coding alone.

What's next for DebateMonkey

Our next focus is going to be implementing the key elements that were missed, specifically ballot entry and judge enrollment. Some UI changes and overall bugfixes and I think debate monkey could be a viable product.

LocationTracer,https://hackcuv.devpost.com/submissions/113786-locationtracer,"Inspiration

Inspired by true social incidents and happenings across the world. in many countries such as egypt, moroco,india we experience a constant backlash on women and children such as sexual assualt, even in the most crowded or desserted places. this may even happen to our friends or family. 
we cannot always depend on police and the government in these kind of emergencies as these countries are few of the most corrupted and insecure places in the world. 
but we believe we can always depend on the technology we have and the ability of using it to solve real world problems. and also we can depend on friends and family. 

we developed a hack where we can get to know the location of a missing beloved ones or who we think can be in danger as soon as possible with exact longitude and latitude even when there is no access of INTERNET connectivity.

What it does

This is an app which enables users to identify their beloved ones if they are out of reach. This application sends an SMS to the person whose location we want to know. Then the sms invokes an Android application and that application fetches the latitude and longitude of the user. Then it embeds that data in a Google Maps URL and send it back as an SMS to the user who requested it.

How we built it

We built the entire project on Android Studio using JAVA. We have also Android SQLite Database to store the preferences of the users. 

Challenges we ran into

Access Control is the first challenge we ran into. No user would ever like to reveal his data to an anonymous person. He would like to limit the number of people who can know his location at any point of time. So, maintaining that access control was the first hurdle.
Getting the latitude and longitude values not null is the second hurdle we passed. We used a loop and kept changing the sources of GPS location(both Internet and GPS device) and when ever we get a valid data, we exit the loop.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

The main thing that we are proud is the application has amazing accuracy. It can detect an average of 5cm motion in the mobile phone. This application survived many extreme test case conditions. This is the fastest way to retrieve a users location without flooding. 

What we learned

We learnt the implementation of BroadcastReceiver in Android and also considering the extreme conditions while developing a software application.

What's next for LocationTracer

We are looking forward to implement geofencing in it so that we can have a device with the kids and get to know if they crossed our neighborhood. We also have a designing the UI in a more enhanced manner.

cyber-security-escape-room,https://hackcuv.devpost.com/submissions/113794-cyber-security-escape-room,"Inspiration

We wanted to make a fun and engaging game that would help middle and high school students learn and practice with topics related to cyber-security. 

What it does

It allows the player to explore the different cyber-security concepts as they solve puzzles to exit the room. 

It takes place in a room with different intractable stations. Each station is a computer, safe, or something similar and must be navigated using a command line built into the game. The player practices using some linux commands and solves puzzles related to crytographic concepts. The player must use all the clues to figure out the final password and escape the room. 

How we built it

We used pygame to make the game.
We researched cybersecurity concepts and translated them into puzzles to engage the students playing our game

Challenges we ran into

Making a terminal in the game that accepts broad input
Lack of knowledge in cyber security topics

Accomplishments that we're proud of

Fleshing out an idea in 24 hours with a brand new team in a topic we were not too comfortable in

What we learned

How to convert educational topics into fun puzzles and other parts of our game
How to make a terminal
How to work with pygame

What's next for cyber-security-escape-room

We see our game as a draft for a platform that can be used to educate all skill levels in cyber-security. There is also a lot of room for customization and for creating an online level creation and sharing app.

Eddie,https://hackcuv.devpost.com/submissions/113802-eddie,"Inspiration

Google recently released a very similar feature for their Pixel phones. As an iPhone user I was jealous and wanted the same thing for my phone.

What it does

When I decline a call (or it's blocked) the call is redirected to a digital assistant which asks the caller who they are and why they're calling. That recording and transcript is then sent to my phone via push notification. After reviewing the message I can choose to have the call connected or send them to voicemail.

How I built it

The core code is written in JavaScript. The back-end is done with node.js and the front-end is a react-native app. Missed call forwarding setup varies by carrier, but for Verizon it is activated by dailing *71. The calls are forwarded to a Twilio phone number which is controlled by the back-end. After the message is recorded via Twilio the audio is send to Google Cloud's Speech Recognition API with the model set to phone_call.

Challenges I ran into

The primary challenge I ran into was figuring out how connect a Twilio phone number to receive calls for my actual number. It took a lot of research before I discovered the missed call forwarding feature (which I now understand that most carriers support).

Accomplishments that I'm proud of

I'm very proud that the whole system works and is genuinely useful.

What I learned

I learned how to use the Twilio phone call API and how to tunnel the react-native development server over USB.

What's next for Eddie

Clean up the code, implement multi-user support on the server, and then App Store release.

Prisoner-s-Dilemma,https://hackcuv.devpost.com/submissions/113822-prisoner-s-dilemma,"Inspiration

I read about people using prisoner's dilemma like computer simulations which reproduce themselves based on the outcome of these situations. This experiments help simulate the evolution of altruistic and selfish survival strategies. I wanted to test this myself to see what the result was. 

What it does

It sets up a program with ""organisms"" with many different prisoner's dilemma strategies. The user can then have each one pair off against another in rounds of competition and see how which strategies are most successful. 

How I built it

I built it in C++  by creating a linked list of ""organisms"" with memory of past interactions. New organisms are added when they compete and every other node in the list is removed when it becomes too big. There is also a user display.

Challenges I ran into

I had trouble making sure my numbers were accurate, i.e. I didn't accidentally count the same increase in two different functions or neglect to count them. I also ran into problems with exiting loops at the correct times. My result wasn't what I expected, so I interpreted the results within the context of the experimental ""environment"" and made 2 altered simulations. 

Accomplishments that I'm proud of

I successful got the simulation to work and created a flexible interface with the user. I predicted why my code behaved the way it did and made two altered versions of it with different behavior. 

What I learned

I expanded my experience with linked lists and created a way of simulating evolution that I could expand on in the future. I learned about the viability of different moral strategies in the conditions presented in my simulation. 
I learned to look at how my code is structured to explain its behavior.

Simulation1: In this simulation cooperative organisms are initially the most successful, then uncooperative organisms take over. I figured out this is because at first organisms are more likely to be paired with organisms like themselves and over time it becomes more random.

Simulation2: In this simulation uncooperative organisms are the most successful for the entire duration. This is because the pairings are entirely random.

Simulation3: In this simulation cooperative organisms are successful for the entire duration. This is because organism's ""children"" are clustered near the parents, so they are more likely to be paired with similar organisms. 

What's next for Prisoner-s-Dilemma

I would like to alter the simulation to see how it preforms with simulated reputation. I predict reputation will make cooperative strategies more viable.

Phishing detection game,https://hackcuv.devpost.com/submissions/113826-phishing-detection-game,"inspired

By true events 

educates and prevents children on phishing and identity thefts

firstly we have copied the UI of facebook by downloading their source code and by getting registered into a onilne domain, then for the phishing , we redirected facebook login to our own php file.Now that we have users credentials, we navigate them to an ordinary website making sure the user doesn't doubt us.

Challenges we ran into

The main challenge we fought was dealing with development of a tool that has the ability to detect such websites. We had to try numerous machine learning models inorder to get the best accuracy.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

We have a whooping accuracy of 99.1% in detecting phishing websites and even implemented that in a python GUI application.

What we learned

We learned about developing Python GUI applications and some machine learning models.

How I built it

Used dart and the flutter framework to create a mobile app for both ios and android. I also used the google maps api to create a dynamic map and add markers to the map which could be discovered by users.

Challenges I ran into

The original flutter plugin I wanted to use was broken which required a lot of time to get working properly. Along with that the original haversine plugin I was going to use did not work with the most recent version of Dart which caused me to have to recreate the plugin. 

Accomplishments that I'm proud of

Implemented google maps api

RapidPark,https://hackcuv.devpost.com/submissions/113831-rapidpark,"Inspiration

Parking at the Colorado School of Mines is always a tricky task-- our parking lots are on average 91% full during the week according to Mines' parking services. With so many cars and so little spots on campus, students often have to search for over 15 minutes to find a spot to park before class. We decided that it was time to put an end to this parking madness by taking a technological step in the right direction. Our solution-- RapidPark!

What it does

RapidPark provides both students and parking services with the technology necessary to lessen stress around parking on school campuses. For the student, RapidPark is a web-based application that acts as an easy reference for parking spot availability information. For parking services, it provides a system of license plate recognition and authorization to streamline ticketing and lot analysis.

On the hardware front, RapidPark is a system of cameras stationed at entrances to parking lots that detects cars entering and leaving the parking lot. When a car is detected, it will update the current lot capacity on our heat-mapped google maps web application. The system updates in real-time, and uses fast computer-vision classification APIs to take the images of the cars and detects aspects of them, such as their license plates.

How we built it

We built RapidPark around an Angular webapp utilizing Python Flask on the backend. Any ""detection system"" that is capable of HTTP requests has the ability to update the parking lot availability. We used Python OpenCV for motion detection and frame parsing to detect direction and key frame grabs during the motion. We tested this system on a raspberry Pi 3, and subsequently created an entire detector for ~$50.

Challenges we ran into

Many of the challenges that we ran into centered around the use of APIs. We were thrilled to see how many APIs were available to us using the RapidAPI interface. Some APIs were harder to get started with than others, however. We wanted to use Google Cloud storage for our application-- however due to our unfamiliarity with API authentication, we couldn't to get Google Cloud strorage up and running couldn't implement it in the end.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

RapidPark is extremely fast and extremely intuitive. It also serves as a solution to a very real problem-- parking is consistently identified as one of the biggest problems on the Mines campus and we are confident it is similarly stressful on other campuses as well. RapidPark serves a very useful, inexpensive, and easily implemented tool to solve this parking issue. RapidPark was also very fun to develop, especially the more we got into it!

What we learned

Flask, Javascript, and rapidAPI! Before this project we were all novices in the use of APIs. Now, we feel much more confident in using them! Additionally, this application was a great mesh of frontend and backend development. Thus, we learned a lot about full stack development!

What's next for rapidPark

We would love to further implement the administrative side of RapidPark for real-time parking violation detection. Currently the system has the ability to identify license plates, we aim to streamline the authentication of these license plates for use with parking services.

NEkeyMark2,https://hackcuv.devpost.com/submissions/113864-nekeymark2,"Our inspiration came from typing papers late into the night and waking up the next morning with ache-y wrists. And that's when it hit us. There has to be a better way. Standard keyboards can be great for fast and accurate typing, but  we are not all blessed with ten working fingers and two working wrists. 

That is why we have created NEkey (pronounced ""any key"").

NEkey allows users to control both keyboard and mouse inputs using only a common video game controller. We achieved this by making two wheel menus around the joysticks. The left joystick selects the layer of different inputs while the right joystick is used to select and type the character.

Twitter User Stats,https://hackcuv.devpost.com/submissions/113883-twitter-user-stats,"Inspiration

We were interested in working with the Twitter API, and thought it would be really interesting to see some general stats about certain profiles. 

What it does

Our program analyzes a given user profile's page and calculates interesting stats. For example, their most popular tweets and most popular followers

How we built it

We used Python as a back end, taking advantage of Tweepy and the Twitter API. From there, we used Flask to integrate our Python with the front end, which was comprised of HTML and JavaScript.

Challenges we ran into

Figuring out how to use the Twitter API at first was confusing at first. We spent a lot of time looking at references to see what we could do with it. Also, We ran into problems with connecting the front end HTML files and the back end Python code. We eventually settled on using Flask which is a Python based code that allows a seamless integration between Python code and HTML basics. We had to make some compromises due to time and lack of experience, including not doing embedded tweets, but we believe it turned out pretty well.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

This is our entire team's first hackathon, so we are really proud of how our project ended up with this in consideration. It was Jacob's first major program in python, and his first time ever using an API. Dylan and Connor are really proud of figuring out how to take Jacob's back end and connect it to a front end, as they have never done this before either.

We will probably work on minor improvements from here, possibly running outside of flask so that others can use the service by using an online server instead of a local one. Also, if we can figure out embedded tweets that would be great.

Surf - Predictive Browsing Plugin,https://hackcuv.devpost.com/submissions/113885-surf-predictive-browsing-plugin,"#26

Inspiration

When thinking about how to use big data for good, we came up with the concept for Surf in order to help users understand their browsing habits and patterns as well as make some common tasks quicker and easier.

What it does

Surf is a Chrome extension that intelligently suggests sites a user may want to visit based on browsing activity, such as browsing history, mouse movements, and user habits. At the top right of each site, users will see an unobtrusive list of suggestions for that site that displays actions that they would normally take. By mousing over this bar at the top right, users will see an expanded list from which they can select their next destination. Finally, users have access to an analytics page, which includes a visualization of their usage patterns.

Surf also has a companion Android app that allows users to look at their browsing habits as well as access their most used links. The app receives the user data live from the server and displays the current link and a set of suggested pages so that a user can quickly pickup their browsing on their phone. The app also helps provide a better visualization of what a user's web browsing patterns look like at any given link.

How we built it

The extension collects various metadata such as browser history and mouse activity and uses a PageRank-style algorithm to determine a list of suggestions for each website a user visits, and this list changes dynamically as users continue to browse. It syncs this data to a Firebase database, which the companion app reads from. The companion app then translates the data stored onto the server into multiple different components such as webpage title and favicon to present the user with readable data. This data then goes through an adapter we created that compiles this data into cards that are displayed on the screen.

Challenges we ran into


We had to build an algorithm in order to calculate suggestions
Generating/collecting test data to assist in modifying the algorithm was time-consuming
Adding this data to a server took more time than initially planned
Hooking up the extension and app to Firebase complicated things considerably 


Accomplishments that we're proud of

The extension is sleek and genuinely useful, and the Android app provides interesting insights into user browsing habits. The app also reads live from a server, and therefore can be used to expand a user's experience.

What we learned

Building and testing something that's meant to handle lots of data is difficult to do quickly, and adding users and databases complicates things even more. Integrating components of the project written in different programming languages also required a significant amount of extra parsing to connect them.

What's next for Surf - Predictive Browsing Plugin


Enhance algorithm by training a machine learning classifier (we need to collect more real data)
iOS companion app, Firefox/Safari/etc. extensions
More sophisticated user handling/login system
End-to-end encryption of user data

randomDomainName-Do Not Let Your Mom See This,https://hackcuv.devpost.com/submissions/113887-randomdomainname-do-not-let-your-mom-see-this,"Inspiration

When you are out on the internet, there are stuff that you don't necessarily want your parents, especially your mom to see...

What it does

Ideally, this website is going to be having feeds of random stuff that are not parents-appropriate.
But right now, it's just a random website that is rather appropriate for all-ages.

How I built it

I started with registering the domain name from domain.com, then i started to work on the webpage. I coded the html and css at first. Then I ran into the problem of animating the count-down effect on the 2nd page. So I asked for help on the mentor channel of Slack. Lauren Raddatz came over and helped a lot. After trials and errors of changing codes, switching css to scss and switching it back, We figured out achieving the desired result by modifying a code snippet of javascript online. So the whole webpage is then completed and ready to be published to the web. Then it came to the challenge of finding a web host for my site. I approached mentors on slack, got lots of great suggestions but at last decided to just use another github page to host the domain. Then it's the problem of figuring out how to link my githubpage ixianglll.github.io with the domain name that i registerd link . I had to refer back to another website that I have, which is another domain purchsed from google domain but also hosted through github. The procedure was a bit confusing for the domain.com domain, because there are more than 15 of additional DNS records whose functions that I don't know of. I had to try out adding different methods of adding type A DNS records and even change out its nameservers on domain.com's end. Besides, I had to go back to github to adjust the codes: to rename the 1st page to be index.html, going into all the codes to fix the link to the images, since they are not at the same designated folder as what's been saved on my computer. After the tiny changes were made. It is now working properly on the designated [http://donotletyourmomseethis.com]

Accomplishments that I'm proud of

Having successfully hosted a domain through github. And the domain name is really cool, isn't it!

What I learned

Keep trying, keep googling, ask for help.
It's always GOOD to fail, because you'll then fix the error and the final product more polished and less breakable.
If the code doesn't work, but you think they should. Give it some moment and let the magic of codes do its thing. After... let's say 30min, hit refresh the page, and BOOM, maybe it'll be working now!

What's next for randomDomainName-Do Not Let Your Mom See This

It will be fun to keep working on it and actually turn it into a fun website with lots of feeds coming in, either generated by the users or crawled from the website or handselected. There should a mechanism to filter out the contents that are ""appropriate"".

MLarketplace,https://hackcuv.devpost.com/submissions/113888-mlarketplace,"Inspiration

When a company is looking to enter the market of Machine Learning, their only real avenue of entry is to hire ML engineers.  This creates large barriers of entry for small businesses which cannot afford to spend millions on previously solved problems.

With MLarketplace we gather metrics on project use, and provide a simplified deployment process. So creators can use their expertise to create optimized and efficient solutions to common ML problems, which clients can then apply immediately to their own system.

What it does

MLarketplace is a website built on a flask server and mongoDB database in order to provide easy access to Machine Learning Solutions.  Developers can easily submit both pre-trained and un-trained projects to the database through a simple HTML form, and from there they have easy access to metrics on how their model is being used.  On the other hand, clients are met with project summaries including project name, developer name, and a readme describing the project.

If a project matches a user's needs, they can access the model using our MLarkeplace client library.  Which allows users to train models with their own proprietary data, use the pre-trained systems uploaded by developers, and most importantly, make predictions on their own system.

How we built it

MLarketplace is broken into three fundamental systems: the client side application where processing occurs, the server which stores our project information, and our library which works as the interface between the two.

Client Side: When a client requests a project from MLarketplace, that model is placed in a sandboxed process to protect both the client and developer's private information.  Each time a client asks a model to predict an answer or score it's accuracy, these usage metrics are passed-through to server counters.

Library: Each function on the database is required to operate on jsons to allow for language portability.  Clients can interface through each model's train, predict and score functions.  Train allows users to tailor models to their own application, predict attempts to extrapolate on a given test vector, and score takes known test vectors and classifications to provide easy accuracy calculations.

Server:  The server is built with flask and manages our mongoDB database. Each entry to the database stores developer information such as project and developer name, and  stores pointers to the model's true definitions and readme files.

Challenges we ran into

One of the major challenges we ran into was how to transport developer code without providing A) providing access to the source file to clients, and B) without putting undue strain on our database.  In order to resolve these problems we needed to both define external file systems and implement some basic sandboxing to prevent over-share of data.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

At the end of this hackathon we have created a solid proof of concept, which can interpret and distribute programs very efficiently and simply.

What we learned

This project involved a lot of web development, an area that none of us specialize in.  We have all gained a lot of experience working with flask servers and mongo databases, using forms to take input, and defining libraries to effectively distribute solutions.

What's next for MLarketplace

There are a couple areas that MLarketplace can benefit from continued development.  A more fully fleshed out user system would have to be created to allow for true enterprise solutions, as there is no account protection and verification currently implemented in the system.

Increasing our focus on security by finalizing the sandboxing of our client running systems.  This includes defining hard limits to processing power allowed to potentially malicious ""models"" and screening developer projects to ensure they meet our specifications.

We have laid the foundation for making MLarketplace truly language agnostic, but there is still work to be done in order achieve that goal.  In order to do this, we would have to transform out library into a server that allows for RestAPI requests.

Cookie Injection but with Real Cookies,https://hackcuv.devpost.com/submissions/113889-cookie-injection-but-with-real-cookies,"Inspiration

We wanted to create a video game that taught the critical skills of the cybersecurity mindset to 3rd-6th graders. The cybersecurity industry is already lacking 300,000 jobs, an early introduction to the cybersecurity mindset will allow society to manage this need. 

What it does

We created both:
a. An example game to play through the first initial levels of our game using the Godot Engine.
b. A white paper on the principles we applied and a development plan for the future. This white paper goes into detail
the future game and level design as well as the cybersecurity learning objectives for each level.

How we built it

We used the Godot Engine to build all of the characters and levels, starting from an initial example stage of a platformer. All assets and code are 100% MIT Licensed or in the Public Domain. We developed our game with this as a priority because we find it incredibly important for schools benefit from this game as much as possible, including analyzing the source code and making improvements as needed. The game is runnable in basically every format: Web, Windows, Mac, and even Linux. This will greatly benefit distribution and adoption.

Challenges we ran into

Neither of us had ever made a game before, so we where learning as we went along. We spent a large amount of time on just getting the dialog box to appear, then even more time trying to get a button that had an image (plus or minus sign) as it's texture. Once we got over those roadblocks and started to figure out how Godot organized and controlled assets, it was much more smooth (choppy) sailing.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

That we have a game to show and a lot of development planning at the end of this! We are both really happy about the knowledge we gained about game design, from 0, to being able to make a basic app. I am also proud that we created something we feel could be actually impactful. Cybersecurity education and outreach is very important both of us.

What we learned

Don't underestimate the time it takes to do basic tasks and learn new advanced software, like a game engine. This was really time and energy intensive, which means we weren't able to create all the examples that we wanted too. We also learned to appreciate some of the abstractions a game development engine provides. Using one editor, we were able to export functional copies for (almost) any platform.

What's next for Cookie Injection but with Real Cookies

Hopefully, Circadence and TCP are interested in this project, and we can discuss what future development and deployment will look like!

Recurtris,https://hackcuv.devpost.com/submissions/113891-recurtris,"Inspiration

This was just a silly idea that I had for a few years now where a game engine repeats recursively where you pop in and out of different layers until you can't handle it anymore. I decided to try this idea with Tetris to see how it might work with this, and whether or not the idea would actually be fun.

What it does

It's a Tetris game, but after you clear 5 lines the drop speed gets significantly slower and a new layer of Tetris is added in! You can jump to each layer of Tetris, pause layers, and try to survive! The goal of the game is to get as many layers deep as you can, but I did try to add a scoring system in as well.

Controls

Arrow Keys/WASD - Move the Tetris piece

Q/E - Rotate the Tetris piece

Enter - Pause the Current Layer - If you pause a layer, all subsequent layers are paused, so if you have 5 layers and pause Layer 2, you also pause layer 3, 4, and 5.

Escape - Go Back a Layer

Space - Go Forward a Layer

How I built it

I built it using Processing.

Challenges I ran into

Getting the recursing working was slightly weird to think about. Besides that, the development of this moved a lot more smoothly than I thought it would, and there were not many challenges, for better or for worse.

Accomplishments that I'm proud of

Honestly, I'm glad that this idea actually works, and that I find it fun in a way!

What I learned

Not a ton was actually learned from this, since this was a silly project; However, I learned how to make a Tetris game, and that the idea was more reasonable than I anticipated!

What's next for Recurtris

It would be cool to add more minigame modes to this, so instead of clearing 5 lines in a Tetris game, you may need to navigate your way through a short platformer game, or have some sort of simple stealth game to add some variety to it.

Poop With Me,https://hackcuv.devpost.com/submissions/113913-poop-with-me,"Inspiration

Locating nearby restaurants is now simpler than ever, but what about amenities that actually require urgency? Our goal was to map and list out all locations of bathrooms, and allow users to rate/review them.

What it does

The app pulls up a map with markers across all nearest bathrooms along with their address and ratings. Upon clicking on each bathroom, users can choose to launch Google maps to find their way to there, or choose to review the location after they are done-- doing so will update that location's average rating.

How I built it

Poop With Me is a native Android app built with Java and Android Studio. We took the City of Boulder, Colorado's Public Restroom Facilities csv, wrote a script to convert it to JSON and imported it into Firebase. Our app calls the Google Maps API and calls Firebase to store and get all user-inputted data.

Challenges I ran into

API for easily finding nearest bathroom was deprecated, rusty Java / Android skills.

Accomplishments that I'm proud of

We had fun and it works! 

What I learned

It's very helpfully to continuously build on working prototypes! Java is a toughie

Attention Monitor - Distracted Driving Solution,https://hackcuv.devpost.com/submissions/113916-attention-monitor-distracted-driving-solution,"Inspiration

A member of our team researched a report on motor vehicle safety from the CDC (Center for Disease Control and Prevention) for a project while in grade school. The report highlighted disturbing facts about distracted driving such as every day approximately 9 people are killed and more than 1,000 people are injured in crashes that involved a distracted driver. In 2015 alone, 391,000 people were injured in motor vehicle crashes, and 3,477 people were killed in crashes involving a distracted driver. ""Distracted driving is driving while doing another activity that takes your attention away from driving. Distracted driving can increase the chance of a motor vehicle crash"" (cdc.gov). Our team became very cognizant of the growing number of incidents and preventable accidents due to distracted driving, and decided to develop an attention monitoring system that could be utilized in several different use cases to monitor and encourage more deliberate engagement while driving a vehicle or operating equipment.

What it does

Our attention monitoring system intelligently monitors a user's head and pupil movement while driving to track when the user is distracted. According to the CDC, visual and cognitive distraction are two of the leading causes of distracted driving, and can lead to serious injuries and loss of life. Our team has imagined several different use cases and implementations of this technology. Attention monitoring and tracking can be used for insurance purposes to determine how engaged and safe drivers are. Other examples include monitoring pilots, bus drivers, equipment operators, and testing the focus of student drivers while participating in Drivers Education. All of the use cases build upon the foundation of attention monitoring and tracking, and can be implemented in different ways to accommodate each use case. When people are driving a car, flying a plane, or operating a piece of motor equipment, it is important that their attention stays on the task they are performing. Once people ""take their eyes off the road"" and become distracted, injuries and fatal outcomes are significantly more likely to occur. Texting and driving is 6 times more likely to get someone in a car accident than drunk driving (icebike.org). The attention monitoring system provides a simple and effective solution to this preventable worriment by tracking the instances that an individual is distracted while driving/flying/operating. Our group has created a specific implementation of the attention monitoring solution designed for the use case of a parent overseeing the quality of their child's driving behavior.

How we built it

Our attention monitor solution and parent/child implementation was built using a Dell XPS 13 laptop running Linux, usb webcam, OpenCV, Twilio, RapidAPI, and Google Cloud. The webcam is used to stream video into the laptop, and the laptop utilizes OpenCV to track the movement of the user's head and pupils. Custom defined thresholds define when a user is considered to be ""distracted."" For instance,  it takes approximately 5 seconds to complete a lane switch (semanticscholar.org), and taking one's eyes off the road long enough to read a text message takes almost 5 seconds to complete (cdc.gov). 5 seconds is enough time to cover a football field at 55mph. If the child is considered to be distracted for more than 5 consecutive seconds, then they are given one strike. After the child gains three strikes, a text message is sent to their parent using Twilio letting them know that their child has been quite distracted while driving. The parent can choose to reply to that automated alert in order to further action. In addition to this, the parent will be able to access an online portal with information including real-time coordinates of the child, real-time location-accurate weather, and histogram representations of driver engagement. The back end was constructed in the web framework Django. Our solution has several diverse applications and markets, so we developed a user interface that is approachable and easy to understand.

Challenges we ran into

The greatest challenge we ran into was trying to create a live updated graph that updated every 20 seconds. One of the main issues was that Bokeh doesn't have clear documentation for their application server implementation in Django. Additionally, Bokeh requires its own port to run its server and with our Django setup we could not run two ports at once unless we set up an Apache server, and we did not have time to do so. After realizing that we could not take this approach we came up with an alternate way of presenting the graphs. We chose to export the graphs to a new html page every time there was new data. The drawback of this approach is that it requires the page to be refreshed every time new data is requested.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

Our team is proud of our collaboration, critical thinking, ingenuity, and the final product. Each one of us has a different technical background and expertise, and we were able to find a way to include everyone's expertise and work together through difficult challenges in order to create an attention monitoring system that tracks when a user is distracted while driving/flying/operating.

What we learned

Our team learned that coming across annoying challenges and bugs are typical to the development process. In addition to this, we expanded our experience in developing with APIs, Django, Geolocation, and SQL.

What's next for Attention Monitor

Our team wants to improve the image recognition system to recognize an individual's head and eyes in more challenging lighting conditions. We want to work on more custom implementations of the solution such as the Parent/Child driving scenario.

Inspiration is a project designed to help facilitate creativity in musicians and help them to create their own music. This is accomplished by creating a random chord progression generation program that attunes itself according to the users likes and dislikes via machine learning. All music is based of off chord progressions and half the battle of creating new music is to find new interpretations of old songs. This program does exactly that. By using different mutex algorithms and functions, we can create these new and unique chord progressions for each individual user. No two users are treated the same and will receive different songs according to their preferences.

When the new technology is finally revealed in the main foyer, you realize that there is a problem. The tech entrepreneur has created a device that has trapped you and the other party goers in the house. The Creeper will slowly escape the game and infect your real-life computer... That is, unless you�۪re able to stop it. Utilizing the help of the industry experts at the party, you must explore the mansion, defend against the attacks, and launch counter attacks against the computer in order to stop the device.

Theme/Genre

Educational Text-Based Meta-Adventure RPG

Elevator Pitch

Inspire interest and curiosity in cybersecurity by introducing general concepts such as cryptography, scripting, and safety in an educational format that stays engaging. The game mechanics aim to simulate the learning environments that are necessary for cybersecurity through the simple text-based environment and introduce intuition.

Audience

Middle to Early High School

Game Flow Summary

This is a single-player RPG in which the player interacts by inputting commands, like the popular game zork. The player will need to solve challenges to open doors and stop the AI in the final server room. The player does so by talking with people and interacting with items. There is an element of interactive fiction in which the student can explore at their own pace, but they still explore the lore of The Creeper story and learn about cybersecurity.

Educational Design

Learning Objectives


Social Engineering
Cryptography
Cybersecurity Concepts and Thought Processes
Scripting
Hacking


Puzzle/Challenge Structure

The puzzle mechanics vary from each level, but they are each based on interacting with characters and objects in an environment. Players learn about the challenge and required objectives to complete the challenge from clues in the environment and interacting with characters, then use them to progress.

Play Flow

The game is linearly structured and the player must open the door to get to the next level. However, this can be done in many ways and orders by talking to different characters or using different objects. Players that already know about cybersecurity may not need to talk to others and can pass the level given their own knowledge. However, levels get harder and the player most likely will have to explore sometime.

Storyline

Setting

Located in a tech entrepreneur's house in the near future.

Characters


You
Partygoers (security experts, children, etc)
Evil AI


Visuals

Text-Based Game w/ minimal visuals. The user will input commands and will be able to see a log of conversation/interaction history. We also have pixelated images that accompany different commands/interactions and a map. In the future, we would like to make a minimap as well as an inventory.

Game Play Mechanics

The gameplay mechanics inspire curiosity by allowing players to explore on their own. This also enforces vital cybersecurity mindset in which one needs to be prevent vulnerability while still being informed and probing a situation. The text-based interaction simulates a social engineering environment as well as a scripting environment.

Controls

Type what you want to do in the text box!

Levels

Phase 1: Cryptography
Intro to the game and introducing mechanics
Level 1 (implemented): Use social engineering to retrieve a key needed to unlock a door protected by a caesar cypher.
Level 2: (planned): U
Level 3: (planned)
Phase 2: Scripting
Gain access to a computer not controlled by 
Level 1 (planned): Use network commands to prevent AI from advancing
Level 2: (planned): ssh into a remote computer to retrieve house blueprints
Phase 3: Hacking
SQL Injection, Buffer Overflow to destroy certain parts of AI.
Phase 4: Safety
The AI has started to prey on the partygoers using phishing emails and scams. Differentiate between fake websites and emails.
Final Phase
The AI has gained access to your own computer (outside of the game). Use your learned knowledge to destroy the AI in the final boss level.

Technical Requirements

The user interacts with the game through natural language commands, implemented using Word2Vec. 

Scoring Method

There is not a scoring method. This is instead to introduce students who have never been exposed to cybersecurity so they can experience the field and gain a curiosity for it. Students can take how long they want and even explore more if they want to!

Our Implementation

Our implementation consists of a base demo for the first level. It is an extremely early alpha with loads of bugs. In our demo first level, the player needs to find the key to a Caesar Cypher through social engineering some of the people at the party. There is always more to be explored, as students can learn more about the CIA Triad as well as Cyber Risk by talking to some of the people there. Our set of actions is limited and the natural language pipeline (Word2Vec cosine similarity) we are using is not perfect, but it works better than expected. 

Future Work

We only have the first demo alpha game. We need to implement other levels and could improve on the parser.

Virtual Xylophone with Gesture Control over the cloud,https://hackcuv.devpost.com/submissions/113920-virtual-xylophone-with-gesture-control-over-the-cloud,"Inspiration

We were inspired by the need to play any instrument over the internet with good audio quality while preserving the real time experience. 

What it does

It uses touch sensors to detected the notes and sends the data of which note has been touched. This data is being used to reproduce the sound on a remote speaker using python script and cloud.
Also, a gesture control system is integrated which gives control of whether the song is to be recorded, when to stop recording and when it has to be replayed.

How we built it

We used three photon boards ,8 touch sensors and a leap motion sensor.

Virtual Xylophone system:
This employs a photon board and it detects the note touches and sends this data to the end user. This data is transferred over the internet which enables any number of end users to listen to the music. Any number of users can listen by subscribing to the channel

Gesture Control System:
This employs a leap motion sensor and a photon board. The leap motion data is parsed using a python script and is posted onto a serial terminal for the photon board to subscribe to. 
The gestures inputs help to start recording, stop recording or playback the song that has been recorded.
The photon board is used to transfer the gesture command over the cloud

User Speaker system:
This employs a photon board and runs a Python script.
The photon board receives the cloud data and produces the sound of the notes corresponding to the data received from the virtual xylophone system. The Python scripts helps in producing the sound of the notes and also to record or replay the music based on the commands received from the gesture control system

All the individual systems communicate over the cloud

Challenges we ran into

Making the gesture control and leap motion work. Making Leap motion compatible with Python.
Parsing serial data dumped by the python script to be used by photon cloud

Accomplishments that we're proud of

Making three photon boards communicate over the cloud

What we learned

We learned how to integrate a gesture control system. Also we learned how the data  are being sent over the cloud.

What's next for Virtual Xylophone with Gesture Control

We can further improve it to other instrument being capable of making it into virtual

BlockStory,https://hackcuv.devpost.com/submissions/113921-blockstory,"Inspiration

We wanted to try something completely new, and decided on trying to build a decentralized application. With this, we wanted to build a platform where users collaborate to make something special, all the while keeping the contributions secure and from verified sources, and to avoid spamming and profanity. 

What it does

BlockStory is a collaborative storytelling platform, where users can use their Ethereum to create new stories or contribute to existing ones, in order to create special and secure stories, free of spam, profanity, and from verified sources. The fee allows the smart contract transactions to be mined and verified before being added to the blockchain. This platform could be expanded to a wide variety of collaborative mediums.

How we built it

The project was built using Smart Contracts with Solidity, on the Ethereum Blockchain. We used the Truffle framework for the Smart Contracts. A local blockchain is hosted with Ganache, creating fake accounts with large amounts of Ethereum for testing, and Metamask for routing the Smart Contract transaction requests to the Ganache server. The frontend was built with React.js and Semantic UI.

Challenges we ran into

Since this was our first time using Blockchain technology, we ran into challenges with setting up Truffle, Ganache, and Metamask. Since string manipulation isn't included in Solidity, we needed to find ways to check the texts for profanity, which was another challenge. Finally, we ran into issues linking the React frontend with the Smart Contracts.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

We're proud of finishing a Blockchain project that is functional during the hackathon, having known barely anything about the technology before the event. 

What we learned

We learned about Smart Contracts, the Ethereum Blockchain, Solidity, Truffle, Ganache and Metamask.

What's next for BlockStory

Adding validation from external sources such as text analysis would improve on our current text analysis in the Smart Contract for the stories.  A voting system to approve and validate bits of text into the stories would make the entire platform more collaborative as well. We can also expand it to different forms of media or things to validate such as collaborative HTML/CSS code.

Unhackable: Cyber Security Learning Platform Concept,https://hackcuv.devpost.com/submissions/113922-unhackable-cyber-security-learning-platform-concept,"Inspiration

Due to a shortage of cybersecurity talents, we aim to find a solution to get the next generation to learn about the relevancy of cybersecurity threat in their daily life and in the world around them in order to inspire the want to pursue a career in cybersecurity particularly those students in disctrict that may not previously have the opportunity to learn this topic.

What it does

Unhackable is a concept for a platform for students and educators to access interactive learning content regarding cybersecurity concepts. Educators will be able to access lesson plan and instructional materials to aid their teaching. Students and access interactive learning modules which serve as learning material and learning incentive. 

How we built it

Unhackable module's demo is created using GameMaker2 

Challenges we ran into

The biggest challenge is certainly the design elements of this project. Making an educational game is very different than simply making a game. It was difficult to try to think about all the needs of our targeted demographic. Trying to convey informational in a more graphical way was also very challenging as we have to also consider how can we make the material more engaging. We have to keep our attention on the targeted audience not what convinence for the programmers. 

We are not very experienced with GameMaker application nor do we have much art/ graphical ability so this is a very new experience for us.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud of a concept that was able to utilize everyone's skill set and target audience-centric and we also happy to be able to create a working prototype from software than we have never used before. 

What we learned

As much as technical skills are important it is only as good as the idea that you can generate. Although the demo was not constructed of very complex algorithms or technologies, we put a lot of energy into researching the targeted audience and how to better convey high-level concepts in a way that everyone can understand. From experience, the high school crowd is not the easiest to please. 

What's next for Unhackable - The Cyber Security Learning Game

To complete one fully complete module that is classroom ready.

Reactstrap Playground,https://hackcuv.devpost.com/submissions/113923-reactstrap-playground,"Inspiration

We were originally wanting to do something with RapidAPI, but could not get that working in time, so we pivoted and created a little tutorial/guide through some of the features of react.

What it does

This webpage contains a few tools for someone to ""customize"" their React webpage, including a slider for heading size and a color wheel to choose their background color.  Each of these features also updates real-time to show what code the user would have to write to achieve the same outcome.

How we built it

We started from scratch using react's create-app, and built in dynamic and static features by hand from the ground up.

Challenges we ran into

Since we pivoted a bit late into the hackathon, we scrambled for a bit trying to come up with an alternative idea.  Also, Javascript and React had their own challenges for us, since we are mostly novice coders.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

We actively communicated and pushed our work through GitHub without breaking anything.  We finished with a product we are generally proud of generating in roughly 15 hours.  This project could be expanded into many industries and the concepts could be reused for other programs.

What we learned

24 hours is not a lot of time.  Communication is paramount to success.  Having an idea coming into a project does not mean it will stay.  Versatility is easier to say than accomplish.

What's next for Reactstrap Playground

Unfortunately, this hackathon might have to be the lifespan for this project, as we are all busy in our schooling and career searches.

Mocking Bird,https://hackcuv.devpost.com/submissions/113924-mocking-bird,"Inspiration

We wanted to build something that lets companies use social media to improve their products and attract more potential investors.

What it does

Users type any search item in box and the app summarizes people's sentiment towards this topic in live stream mode. This is mainly geared towards public relations officers that want to analyze people's sentiment towards their company in real time. 

How we built it

The frontend part of app uses Java. The backend is written in Python and uses Tweepy (python wrapper for Twitter API) and text sentiment analysis method api. We collect 20 tweets in real time, and then run sentiment analysis for all the tweets. Then the interface shows the summary in a user friendly way.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

We were able to learn and effectively use APIs within just a few hours of the hackathon. 

What I learned

We learned how to work together as a team. We also learned to use APIs that we had no idea existed a couple of days ago!

What's next for Mocking Bird

1) Letting users collect tweets within a certain time interval to see changes in public perception.

2) Adding visual aspect to the summarization part.

3) Enable voice commands for topic searching.

Cyber Snake,https://hackcuv.devpost.com/submissions/113925-cyber-snake,"1. Game Title

Cyber Snake

2. Summary

The Elevator Pitch
This game will make a 10-13 years old kid play for hours having fun while he is learning basic cyber security aspects. Nothing is what it seems to be on real Internet 

Theme/Genre
Modern arcade game

Audience
10-13 years old kids

Game Flow Summary
Cyber Snake is a brilliant endless arcade game in which you take control of a snake. Your snake can only hit the objects that corresponds to the answer of the question game. When a correct object is hit, the user will earn 5 points. Those are the different types of challenges while playing:
Cryptography: A word is said to the user. If the word to encrypt is , the user must hit those word objects that its letters are in the right in the alphabet. Like  for . So, any ���d�۝ is transformed to an ���e�۝ and any ""a"" is transformed to ���b�۝:

ABCDEFG
|.......|........
BCDEFGH          

In order to be easy at the beginning we could use two letter that are very close together in the alphabet. As difficult is the lever, the difficulty can increase by adding more letters, more displacement and larger words.

Passwords: Word objects appear with passwords in it.User must avoid easy-to-hack passwords such as ���hello�۝ ���12345�۝ ���catsandogs�۝, and hit the objects with difficult passwords. Difficult passwords of each level will be:
Easy: Those that have lower and capital letters.
Medium: Those that have numbers and lower and capital letters.
Easy: Those that have numbers, lower and capital letters and special characters

Authentication: It will be shown an emoji. Then, the user will have to avoid all the emojis that are not that one, and catch the one. 

An increase to the difficulty, we could ask security questions to the user, 4 responses could be provided as 4 objects and the user cannot avoid not hitting any of them. Two security questions could be asked:
What was your last score?
What was your highest score?

Back-up data: Used as a checkpoint. If you don�۪t catch the back-up data object a message will be shown, notifying that the user that data can be lost in case of emergency, or a Game Over. In the case the user hits the Back-up data object and then he dies, he will restart the game in the last Back-up data object hitted. So he doesn�۪t have to start from the beginning. 
Firewall (not designed): Two types of emojis will approach the user. One of them will be a ���known access�۝ and the other one a ���not-known access�۝.

3. Educational Design

Learning Objectives
Every time the user makes a  bad decision, we explain them why it was a bad decision and so we explain them the cyber security theory behind that game mode. This theory difficulty and completeness of the method will increase when the level of the game is higher.

This theory will include the following points:
Cryptography
Difficult password generator
Authentication
General Cyber Hygiene: Back up data
Firewall

Puzzle/Challenge Structure
Every time the user completes a level, the difficulty increases and the feedback given is even more complex.

The main idea is to start with very basic cyber security concepts at the beginning levels and make them more difficult once the player reaches higher levels.

Play Flow
Images to explain the play flow

4. Storyline

Setting
They user will be able to select between Easy, Medium and Advance levels.

Apart of increasing the difficulty of the levels, the snake will move faster so the user will have less time to think about the correct solution.

Another setting is that the user can choose to play any random mode of game or to select an specific one. 

Characters
The main character is a ���snake�۝ which will be the one that the user will control. 

5. Game Play Mechanics

Controls
The snake will move Left/Right as the user scrolls his finger left/right the screen.
There are going to be some levels where the user will have to ���kill�۝ some bad guys shooting balls.

Levels
For the MVP  the user could select between Easy, Medium and Advanced. And select a random game of mode or an specific one. 

For the next iteration, there could be an ���infinite�۝ number of levels. Starting at level 0 where the cyber security knowledge will be very basic, every time the user finishes a level, the difficulty of the challenges will increase, the learning feedback will have more technical aspects and the snake�۪s speed will increase so the user will have a shorter time to think.

Technical Requirements:  AI, Art Assets
It will be implemented with 2-D Unity. No AI needed, just easy programming skills on Game development. Art Assets may be needed to increment user experience. UI is very important for kids to get engaged on the game. 

It is known that 10-year-old kids focusing is not stable, so it will have to be implemented colorful and with trendy music played on. 

6. Scoring Method

For the MVP, in the main screen appears the last score and the highest score for the game of mode selected in the Settings.

For the next iteration, as we will have levels the score will increase proportionally to the number of levels the user survives playing. The further you get, the more points you have. If some ���missions�۝ are completed, such as catching the correct words, some points will be awarded too.

There will be a global ranking and a friends ranking. This will engage the user to keep playing until they reach the top of the ranking. You can connect with facebook, instagram and phone book numbers (as kids of this age may not have an account to those social networks), so friends competing will be one of the main points on kids to be engaged.

THE PACKAGE PROTECTOR

Use Protection��

Ever had an expensive package destroyed in the mail? Probably. It's happened to all of us at some point.

But now, with the advent of inexpensive microcomputers like Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and Qualcomm Dragonbard 410c, companies can provide a near-omniscient view of your package from the moment it leaves the warehouse to the moment it shows up at your door.

In the future, you can log in to a website and get minute by minute updates on your package's condition, but for now, we're using Twilio's API's to send you critical information as it occurs and Rapid's APIs to give you premium access to maps so you can check the exact location of your important goods.

To prove we're the best, we check our data against UPS, DHL, FedEx, and USPS, and with the ability to get detailed statistics about your order delivered direct to your phone, filing damaged or lost package claims is dead easy.

The microcomputer will come stocked with a variety of sensors including:


GPS for accurate tracking of your package. Out with tracking numbers and in with real-time updates
Accelerometer to let you know if your fragile package had and unexpected bumps or bruises in transit
Water sensor in case of the unfortunate event of dropping your package in the ocean


We care deeply about your package, and you should too. There's no better way to ensure your package is insured and lives up to the high shipping costs you pay.

HitMemeUp,https://hackcuv.devpost.com/submissions/113927-hitmemeup,"Inspiration

We wanted a handy way to get memes (like giphys on slack) and we decided the most convenient way to do this would be to send query to a server over text and receive images/gifs back.

What it does

It is very simple, text a query for an imgur image, receive a random image that matches that query.

How we built it

We used a flask backend in a docker container on a remote server to handle requests from Twilio and retrieve image URLs from Imgur.

Challenges we ran into

Coming up with a valid idea was a challenge, we wanted a project we could finish and something that would be interesting and useful; hence the simplicity. In terms of actual development, we had issues retrieving some images because they where embedded in an album of one image. In order for the app to actually send images, as opposed to links to images, we had to dig through the Imgur api and combine a few api calls in order to retrieve the image URL.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

Going from concept to ""finished"" project. I think its easy to come up with a big grand idea and after 24 hours have that cut back to the bare working minimum. 

What we learned

We learned how to use Twilio and how powerful it can be. We also learned how to take our vague idea and polish it out.

What's next for HitMemeUp

We would like to expand it so we can send memes to other people and also pull memes from other sources.

Data-Mining Clickstreams,https://hackcuv.devpost.com/submissions/113932-data-mining-clickstreams,"Inspiration

We had an interest in data science, and Oppenheimer Funds had a large set of data that needed analyzing.  

What it does

The project attempts to organize seemingly unrelated clickstream data into a group of clusters that should cover roughly 80% of web traffic to oppenheimerfunds.com  

How we built it

We used python and Unix terminal commands to break down the data into smaller groups that were then funnelled into the Google Cloud platform to produce graphs.  

Challenges we ran into

The data sets produced graphs that were too complex to be generated on a local machine. We needed to utilize the computing provided by Google's Cloud computing to generate some of the graphs.  

Accomplishments that we're proud of

We succeeded to graph a number of the data sets we produced.  

What we learned

TransparentHouseContract,https://hackcuv.devpost.com/submissions/113934-transparenthousecontract,"College students only receive information that landlord provides thus they get swindled 

Inspiration

We have been victim of the backdoor and shady landlords and bad properties. I should not have been living in home where the lead paint was covered up, or where the windows would not open in room leaving us with no fire escape. Landlords use unethical methods because they know that college students need cheaper housing. But they should not have to find out bad parts of places that they live. We want to bring transparency to the college renting market. We want to know what the status of our rental properties before we move in. We want to know what other renters have paid so we know that they market is fair. We want to see the true status of the house before and after every renter has moved in and out. 

What it does

We built a Soildity smart contract to not only pay rent every month to the landlord but keep all information transparent. 

How we built it

We used Remix an online solidity complier to not only test on a mock blockchain with fake ether

Challenges we ran into

The Moving parts in a contract. We have limited experience in Soildity so we are still trying to understand how object interact with a contract. We struggled with how to make everything viewable in a very functional way

Accomplishments that we're proud of

We wer brave enough to keep going after all of our failed ideas and challenges. 

What we learned

Soildity is difficult. It is hard to figure out how to keep track of objects but also not over spend the gas money that each user would need to interact with the contract

What's next for TransparentHouseContract

We would love to add more functionality. It would love to be able to have a logical flow of what the property looks like, keep track of damages, repair and inspections.

youtube-comment-analysis ,https://hackcuv.devpost.com/submissions/113936-youtube-comment-analysis,"Inspiration

We wanted to provide content creators with a tool that gives them a more in-depth understanding of their communities reception of their videos. A simple like and dislike bar doesn't accurately model the views sentiment of a video, and going through thousands of comment manually is incredibly inefficient. In addition, a like/dislike bar only is heavily weighted towards the initial reactions to a video, and looking at the comments in a structured way can give you an idea of how people are reacting to it much later.

What it does

The program is a single page application where a user gives a Youtube URL and number of comments. The backend uses the Youtube API to pull the most recent comments (about 200), parses them and determines semantics using NLTK, and then gives data back to the user that would be useful. We return a overall sentiment analysis, a measure of toxicity (which is the % of comments are negative), a word cloud of the most popular words, and finally the most positive and negative comments on the video. These tend to be highly exaggerated, and therefore humorous comments, and we had many hours of fun just looking at videos.

How we built it

We used the Python textBlob natural language processing library for the sentiment analysis. We used the Youtube API for pulling comment threads on videos The backed of the website is managed with flask. The front end is a HTML web page powered by bootstrap and jinga templating.

Challenges we ran into


Learning how to use the YouTube API was difficult, because the example code they gave was broken
Figuring out what a content creator was interested in
No one on our team was particularly strong with front end development, so we struggled getting the css working in a way that looked good
Flask was very finnicky and at one point segfaulted
Getting the front end to connect with the backend was tough
Getting the word cloud to display properly was incredibly annoying 


Accomplishments that we're proud of


We are proud of getting all of our analytical tools to work and display data, particularity the word cloud.
That we managed to make any product at all
That we found a package that would help us get the Youtube comments to work
We managed to make our own form of toxicity
The top comments are hilariously bad
emojis are for some reason supported and show up in the word cloud

CAN Theft Auto: Blockchain,https://hackcuv.devpost.com/submissions/113938-can-theft-auto-blockchain,"Inspiration

Modern computer systems rely on logging events to keep track of actions that have taken place on a system. However, these logs aren't secured in any way, so if an attacker compromises a system they can modify those logs to remove any traces of their presence. This was an issue in the attacks on the Ukrainian Power Grid, where logs were deliberately modified by attackers to hide their tracks.

What it does

Our solution was to create a blockchain of log contents, so the information could be verified and any changes could be flagged. Our blockchain logger takes in log data and creates a blockchain out of it by hashing the data to the appropriate difficulty (in our case, 24 bits of zeros), posting the hash and our RSA signature of the has to our website, and publishing the hash, time, and nonce to the Etherium Ropsten Test Network Chain. This means that even if our website is compromised, the Etherium network will have a verifiable copy of the data.

How we built it

We got our data by reading actual vehicle logging information from the GeoTab API. We used that information to build a blockchain where each ""block"" consists of three values: the hash of the previous block, the data we want to have a verifiable record of, and a Nonce, or random number. We published this information to the Etherium Ropsten Test Network Chain using the web3 Python library and a smart contract that we wrote using Solidity, and we also wrote it to a local database. We used this database for our website, which can display the information in an easy-to-understand way.

Challenges we ran into and accomplishments that we're proud of

Writing a Smart Contract in Solidity was surprisingly difficult, partially because Solidity is an unfinished language. There were times when we had to work around Solidity having the framework for implementing a feature but not having implemented the feature yet. Additionally, learning to communicate with our Smart Contract via Python3 was complicated, and it was a very proud moment when we got it to work!

Signing hashes and getting JSON to export the signatures of data was also a challenge, but now we have multiple authentication methods to verify data is correct!

What we learned

We have never written a Smart Contract before, especially not one in Solidity. Trying to wrangle the language into doing a fairly simple task has given us a lot of respect for those who write the complex applications that are deployed to the real Etherium chain.

What's next for CAN Theft Auto: Blockchain

We'd like to flesh out the smart contract we wrote more, and include more data, such as the signature of the hash. We would also like to get real-time data from geotab, but because the car the GeoTab device is in isn't always moving we just used sample data for this project so we had data at-will.

CapSense LED,https://hackcuv.devpost.com/submissions/113939-capsense-led,"What if I made LED's controllable by touch?

Touch sensors are in our everyday life, but with a little work, and a couple of micro controllers, I figured I could add some flare to the ordinary touch sensor. There are only three components: A low power consumption board called the Pearl Gecko, an Arduino Uno, and a strip of LEDs.

What it does

The capacitive touch sensor is housed on the Pearl Gecko. Once it senses a touch, it sends this information via GPIO to the Arduino (Either 0 for no touch, or 1 for touch). The Arduino then takes this information, and drives the LED's accordingly. The buttons on the Pearl Gecko give different types of lights to display!

How I built it

The Pearl Gecko is a low power consumption board, so by default most devices on the board are powered off. In order to turn a peripheral on (like the touch sensor), I had to: enable the peripheral's clocks (in many cases, one peripheral runs off of many different clocks), route the connection, and finally initialize the peripheral. 

Now that the sensor is enabled, I need to establish that a touch has occurred. The sensor has a register that stores its data at all times(0x0 for no touch, and around 0x4050 for a touch). If a touch occurred then the GPIO pin would be set to high. 

In order to have more fun I decided to add push button functionality as well that changed what color and style of LEDs would be displayed.

Moving to the Arduino, the LEDs are driving using the famous FastLED library. This gave me a skeleton structure to code the LEDS off of, as well as well defined values for colors. 

There was one output pin for the LED data, and 3 input pins to read in the Pearl Gecko Data.
There is an interrupt on one of the pins, in order to have stacked LED display. 

Challenges I ran into

The Pearl Gecko uses code that embedded software to satisfy its low power consumption. The Arduino Uno is a board that is higher level. Making these two talk to each other was very difficult at times. I originally wanted to use SPI, UART, or I2C, but I figured that a simple hi-low communication would be the best when talking between two different boards. On/Off is the universal language of the computer world!

Accomplishments that I'm proud of

The response is almost immediate
It works!
It only draws ~5mA

What I learned

*Making different micro controllers that run off of different languages talk to each other is a very intricate process. *

What's next for CapSense LED

I want to piggy back off of my 5mA comment before, if this system only draws that much current here is what is in store with this idea:

Specific board design for this idea
If I could isolate all of the logic onto one board, the power draw would be even less, through some math about ~3mA average. This would allow the addition of flare to any touch sensor system on the market, without impeding the circuitry at all. Why?

3mA is very negligible. 
How negligible?

An iPhone 7 battery has a 1960mAh battery. Meaning you could run this circuitry for 653 hours drawing 3 mA.

SideKick,https://hackcuv.devpost.com/submissions/113942-sidekick,"Inspiration

We were looking into what incentives attract students to events, and the more research we did, the more we knew that students are facing with an issue regarding time management and free food or fun activities don't bother them much. So, we came up with SideKick, an intuitive scheduler.

What it does

SideKick is an App that automatically generates a study schedule using a Canvas LMS integration and a prioritization formula. The schedule is also designed around a student's studying preferences and other extra-curricular activities. Using a redeemable point system, it incentivizes students to follow the schedule.

How I built it

We began making it this weekend using React Native, Javascript and node.js. We used Expo to test the app while building. We used Figma to create our prototype.

Challenges I ran into

Being entirely new to the react native development framework and Javascript, the learning curve was steep. We were happy to be able to create a test app, which works as a to-do list to complete tasks.

Accomplishments that I'm proud of

We are proud of how far we have come with little understanding of javascript and mobile app development in general.

What I learned

We learned how hard it is to learn a new language overnight and how much info is available online to continue working on an idea.

PROJEKT JUICE 2088 VR: 358MECH/fate,https://hackcuv.devpost.com/submissions/113944-projekt-juice-2088-vr-358mech-fate,"Inspiration

11 years ago, our world was irreparably changed. The events of The Occurrence have long been shrouded in layers of corporate secrecy, but everyone alive knows the importance of that world-shattering discovery - JUICE. Long had humanity searched for a source of endless power, but it was not found among the gilded halls of alchemy. This holy grail was found in a far humbler place: The Bar of The Multiverse. The knowledge of Juice, long dormant, resurfaced in 2077. Our search for unlimited energy has ended. The mech wars have just begun.

Our Philosophy

A spectre is haunting Europe--the spectre of Juice. All the Powers of old Europe have entered into a holy alliance to
exorcise this spectre: Pope and Czar, Metternich and Guizot, French Radicals and German police-spies.

Where is the party in opposition that has not been decried as Juicy by its opponents in power?  Where is the Opposition that has not hurled back the branding reproach of Juice, against the more advanced opposition parties, as well as against its reactionary adversaries?

Two things result from this fact.

I.  Juice is already acknowledged by all European Powers to be itself a Power.

II.  It is high time that fans of Juice should openly, in the face of the whole world, publish their views, their aims, their tendencies, and meet this nursery tale of the Spectre of Juice with a Manifesto of the party itself.

What it does

After the overwhelmingly positive response we received to 2019's Award-Winning cult and agnostic classic, PROJEKT JUICE 2077 VR: After Dark, we knew that we needed to take gaming into the future.  For the first time ever gaming has been brought into the 21st century.  By looking further into the future than anyone before us, we can tell a harrowing tale of the folly of man, and the power of Juice.

This interactive experience allows you to enter the cyberpunk dystopian future where mega-corporations are in charge, drinks rule, and mechs are cool.  Juice has provided the means for the downtrodden to rise up against their oppresors.  As a pilot for the Ultimate Multiverse Bar (UMB), you are leading the charge.  Be The Hero the people need.  Suit up, punch buildings, score points, get Juice.

Elijah and I have grown up around computers, video games, and learning to program from young ages. Cybersecurity is something I have a passion for learning more about and Elijah has a knack for game design. We decided to incorporate both to help teach K-12 about SSL certificates.

What it does

This is a 2D adventure game that has the user run between NPC's attaching public and private keys to data to keep a ""chest"" safe with an ingredient needed for a wizard to access the internet.

How we built it

We used Unity, photoshop, C#, and our IDE's to create, code, and design the game along with some free assets online here and there.

Challenges we ran into

Learning how to create a quest object was a difficult situation for me to overcome. After spending a dumb amount of time creating a makeshift version of what I would have liked to do, I came along the idea of using a data structure to store quests along with information about them such as type/objective of the quest, locations to start and end, etc. Animation was an issue we ran into just because of time constraints. We wanted to create better character textures and could have done so if we had an extra 2 hours to create animations.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

Creating a working prototype of a game in under 48 hours (This was my [Chase] first time using Unity) that accomplished goals and complete quests to teach a user about a cyber security topic.

What we learned

I learned Unity from the ground up [Chase]. I knew C++ coming into this which translated nicely into C# with a few slight changes to syntax. Elijah definitely improved his scripting skills for animation and npc tracking.

What's next for Decrypted The Game

We'd like to refine the textures, add more levels with more quests about different topics within the cybersecurity realm. Animation for characters is definitely on of the first things we will tackle however. Maybe even a user customization screen for their character.

Target Age Group: Grades 4-7 (ages 8-12)

Inspiration:

With the world increasingly going digital cybersecurity is important now more than ever. There are many unfilled jobs in the cyber security world with not enough people wanting to study the field. Therefore, more people are needed in the field! 
To help encourage kids to become interested in the field we�۪ve created a game that will help teach them some basics of the cybersecurity field. Our game took inspiration from games such as ���Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?�۝
We wanted this game to be something that kids would enjoy playing while still learning something.

Project Description:

The game would consist of a casebook in which there would be multiple cases that the player could solve. Each case would each have something to do with a topic in cybersecurity. The game is in the format of a point and click. There will be various objects within each scene that the player can interact with. Each scene will have a cipher that the player will need to successfully break before they are able to move on. The game is completed when the student solves all the ciphers in the case.

Goal for Hackathon:

Our goal in this 24 hour hackathon was to create a simple prototype of the game that would showcase one case in a casebook. The cybersecurity concept this case was focused on was encryption and decryption. Various famous ciphers are hidden throughout the game that the player has to solve. Because our game is aimed toward middle-grade children there is a reference manual at the bottom of the screen that the player can reference to find a description of the cipher and the key they must use to break the code.

The narrative of the game is that a middle school student has had their cell phone and their fellow students phone's confiscated and they want it back. Instead of waiting for the principal to return their cell phone the student has decided to take matters into his own hand and find out where the principal has hidden the cell phone. All the teachers at the school used to be members of the CIA and they all have a nasty habit of encrypting everything in his life using various ciphers. The first scene is the student breaking into the principal�۪s office to look for his phone. The student instead finds a sticky note attached to the computer (for a former CIA guy the principal doesn�۪t follow good practices) that is obviously the password. The player then must solve the cipher and enter the password to the computer to gain access.

Once the student gets access to the computer they find an encrypted file on their desktop that contains the cell phone location. Again, the player must then use a different decryption method to decipher what the encrypted file says. The file leads the student to the football field where the gym teacher has left a note that is clearly in Morse Code. The student must use the reference book to translate the message which they then find is still encrypted. So the player needs to decrypt the translated message again. The message is the code to a safe that the student knows is in the gym teacher�۪s office. If the code is inputted correctly then the student gets back their cellphone and has successfully completed the case.

What�۪s Next for Cyber Sleuths:

Adding more cases that the player can solve. Each case will be a new topic of cyber security
Adding a page where the player can encrypt and decrypt their own messages so that the player can get some practice with the ciphers presented in the case.
An idea we were toying around with at the beginning was creating this game as a web app. That way the game could be played anywhere, including cell phones, and if a teacher wanted to use this game in a classroom then they wouldn�۪t have to install the game on every computer.

Proud About:

Learning and building a UI, and a game from the ground up!

Stuff We Learned/New Technologies We Used:

The UI was written in PyQt5. No one on the team had any experience with PyQt or with building a fully functional UI.
Most members of our team didn�۪t have much experience with Python
Our biggest learning goal for this hackathon was to get more practical experience with Python and to learn about UI design and implementation.

Challenges We Faced:

We originally wanted to use PyQt because we thought that we would be able to use QtCreator with the designer to help us build the interface. Then we could spend most of our time linking the scenes.
No one on the team knew anything about PyQt and getting started with doing simple actions such as adding a button to the screen proved to be more time consuming than we expected.
PyQt5 doesn�۪t have a lot of documentation therefore making it difficult for us to figure out how to connect all the UI elements.
We used HTML to display the graphics for the reference manual. This proved to be another challenge we had to overcome because no one on the team had actually used HTML before.

Encrypt-to-Home,https://hackcuv.devpost.com/submissions/113951-encrypt-to-home,"Inspiration

We knew that, psychologically, children are best languages best at a very young age. This includes pattern recognition, which is a large part of decryption. We implemented facilitation style-teaching, which is an effective teaching style that emphasizes ideas of exploration and analysis to develop critical thinking. These attributes help with cyber security and understanding the ideas of encryption. Ideas in our game also reinforces educational ideas, such as mathematics and logical thinking, which are key skills in cyber security and encryption.  This inspired us to design a young children's game aimed to introduce children to the idea of encryption and decryption on the surface level! 

What it does

This is a three-level story/exploration game. Crypto, a lost balloon has been blown away from his home. Read the encrypted sign and decode them to gain hints on how to bring him back home! This is simple, and gives feedback for children who may not pick up on the pattern. Also, this is brightly and colorfully hand-designed to appeal to children at a young age! 

How we built it

We had two members focus on the JavaScript code, one member focus on design, and one member work on a little bit of both. We digitally drew all of the backgrounds, characters, and even specific details. One member used a drawing tablet to deign and put together all of the backgrounds. Another member used an 8-bit art maker to design all of the clickable details (trees, characters, signs, nature, etc.). We purposely hand-designed all of the components because we wanted to appeal to young kids through the colorful 8-bit animations and implementation of nature to create a playful environment. 

Challenges we ran into

Most of our team members were not familiar with object-oriented languages, so it was difficult for us to get started and on the same page. We had to do a lot of self research and find out how to make a beautiful game. None of us has ever coded a game before, and that, initially, was a big challenge.

We are very proud of the interface in our game. We feel very accomplished that we were able to hand design every component, and this game feels like something we truly made. Additionally, we are proud to have made a game through an object-oriented language. In the beginning of the day yesterday, most of our group wouldn't have even known how to print ""hello world"", and within 24 hours, we were able to make a game!

What we learned

We learned a lot about JavaScript, which was something unfamiliar to all of us before. We feel like we have learned a lot about how much research can help us learn a computer language. Also, we learned a lot about efficient way children learn, and how to make games that will help children develop skills in basic encryption!

What's next for Encrypt-to-Home

MAKE MORE LEVELS!
We want to make more levels and possibly implement more challenges that teach children other encryption skills beyond Caesar Cipher to appeal to children who have already mastered the basics!

Back to the Cipher,https://hackcuv.devpost.com/submissions/113952-back-to-the-cipher,"Inspiration

Our inspiration was the history of computer science (and how far we have come) that is not often talked about, and combining it with cryptography which is an important aspect of cybersecurity. Then we combined these ideas with Back to the Future (and time travelling) to add a twist.

What it does

It is an interactive game that takes the user (ideally 12+) through history and teaches them about the origins and advancements of cryptography. 

It will involve various historic scenes that teach them how to use different cryptographic methods by solving puzzles to get back to the present.  

How we built it

We designed the concept and ideas for various levels of the game, as well as mock-up visuals for the game.

Challenges we ran into

Making the game interesting and engaging was a challenge, as well as making advanced concepts simple enough for beginners to grasp.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

We're proud of our idea because we took something that typically wouldn't be mixed (history and cryptography) and made it into an entertaining educational game.

What we learned

We learned a lot about how to engage younger audiences and cater to them while also teaching them.

What's next for Back to the Cipher

Now that we have the idea and examples of levels, our next step is to implement the game for users to actually play.

Web Histotree,https://hackcuv.devpost.com/submissions/113953-web-histotree,"Inspiration

Often times when surfing the web it's easy to get lost and wonder how you arrived at the page you are currently viewing.

What it does

This program builds a directed acyclic graph whose paths coincide with your web browsing history. This is so that it is clear when you clicked on links, created new tabs or windows, or navigated to an alternate website.

How we built it

Using Javascript, Sigma, HTML/CSS, D3 (that didn't work), and polyfill for cross-browser support. 

Challenges we ran into

JavaScript does not play nice with extensions. Much of the functionality afforded by JS is subverted by the extension's own necessities. 

Accomplishments that we're proud of

It works!

What we learned

How Sigma.js works, JavaScript for loops aren't nice, and JS libraries suck in the use of extensions

TangrAI,https://hackcuv.devpost.com/submissions/113954-tangrai,"Inspiration

We are machine learning lovers and we wanted to perform a new project around reinforcement learning. 

What it does

Our program has learnt from zero, how to resolve the Tangram puzzle. The game starts with an empty table, and it have 7 pieces available for resolving the puzzle. The program has learnt itself which order it will put the pieces and the position in where goes each piece.

How we built it

A reinforcement learning project has three main parts: the environment, the agent and the engine. We have built all of this parts from zero, because it has no other projects for Tangram Puzzle. Although, we have used scripts from Github for having an idea. 

Challenges we ran into

Carles is a electronic engineer and Pau is a mechanical engineer. Our main challenge has been the performance of a computer science project of huge difficulty without have studied any degree in computer science. For us, that we love machine learning, this means that we have enough capabilities for achieve and solve successfully computer science projects.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are really proud of finishing it during this hackathon, due to we thought that we would finish our project at home on the next weeks. However, we have not had enough time for finishing the training because it takes to much time and we have run out of it.

MaraudersMap,https://hackcuv.devpost.com/submissions/113955-maraudersmap,"Inspiration

As construction technologies transcend present day limitations on size. We spend more-and-more time in the indoor environment. However, as our environment evolves we need services that compliment this change. Considering that bold GPS is unable to penetrate concrete structures (does not work indoors).
 There is a need for alternate technologies or services that enable location based services (LBS) such as navigation and localization in indoor environments such as Malls, Grocery Stores Universities and Hospitals. bold We believe that indoor localization services can not only help you find your classroom on the first day of school, it can help emergency services locate you in case of of a major health hazard such as fire or injury.

What it does

boldThe Marauder's Map is an indoor localization solution implemented on the Android Platform. bold Considering the sensors suit available on smartphones and their ubiquitous nature, they are the most suitable platform for a realistic and feasible solution to indoor localization challenges. 

How we built it

The Marauder's Map combines dead reckoning (DR) and machine learning (ML) to predict the user's location in real time. Dead reckoning computes the next location of a user based on the previous location and direction estimate from the compass. We combined DR with Wi-Fi fingerprinting-based localization in an energy-efficient manner. Fingerprinting-based techniques deduce the location of a user based on previous knowledge of the environment.   

Challenges we ran into

Wi-Fi fingerprints for a location change over time. This causes issues with maintaining localization accuracy over time. Environmental noise leads to disturbance in magnetic fields, negatively impacting dead reckoning. Wi-Fi scans consume quite a bit of energy and time on a smartphone. We had to find the right balance between the two.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

Completed a fingerprint sampling app and a localization app in under 24 hours!

What we learned

Sharpened my skills with Android development, and APIs to speed-up dev-time!

What's next for MaraudersMap

Combining data from several users in real time, to form a true MaraudersMap.

Mentor,https://hackcuv.devpost.com/submissions/113958-mentor,"Motivation

Many computer science students seek to continue developing their skillset, but lack the proper resources to do so. Mentor seeks to fill this gap by providing a companion tool which builds off of fundamental topics and eases developers into using new languages and unfamiliar environments. 

As of 2018, over 80% of introductory computer science courses are taught using Python. Google's language Go, however, is not taught much in academia. We decided to leverage this fact in our development and provided new programmers with the ability to write Python code and view corresponding Go syntax. This speeds up the process of learning a new language. 

Description

Integration to use Mentor is seamless. A daemon running on your local machine will watch as you write your code and constantly keep the iPad companion app up-to-date. Our Atom plugin also provides visual feedback as you code. To activate mentor, simply wrap more familiar Python code in our special sequence of characters: ""////"". The iPad companion app will then show Go suggestions, using our custom translation algorithm. Mentor also provides direct access to Go's documentation, allowing developers to learn on the fly. By tapping a suggestion on the iPad, Mentor will automatically save the changes to the file! This results in a both agile and educational way to program.

Challenges we ran into and How we built it

There were three main problems we had to tackle in developing Mentor:


Daemons - Build file
Translating Python to Go
Persistance


What's next for Mentor

We hope to soon add support for multiple languages. We deliberately made the translation algorithm very generalized

Titanium Joe,https://hackcuv.devpost.com/submissions/113959-titanium-joe,"Inspiration

CU Combat Bots is competing at UC Berkeley in a 3lb ""Beetleweight"" Combat Robotics competition on March 31st.

What it does

Titanium Joe is has a Combat Robot that can drive up to 15 ft/sec. It features an Egg Beater as its main Kinetic Energy weapon, which has a theoretical max energy of 240J, and tip speed of 1227 m/s.

How we built it

We used OnShape to design a test bed that was 3D printed before the hackathon. We used duct tape to mount most of the components to the bed, and nuts and bolts to secure the motors and motor mounts. During the event, the first prototype of the final body was designed in OnShape, but unfortunately was not 3D printed because it would have taken ~30 hours. An Arduino was programmed to translate signals from a receiver to the PWM waves for the motors.

Challenges we ran into

We had to redesign and reprint the motor mounts twice during the hackathon.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

It drives really well!

What we learned

OnShape is a great tool for collaborating on CAD designs.

What's next for Titanium Joe

Printing the first prototypes for the body, and attaching and testing the weapon system.

Hand Gesture Home Assistant,https://hackcuv.devpost.com/submissions/113960-hand-gesture-home-assistant,"Inspiration

We feel that there is a void to be filled in the area of user interfaces. This project is a demonstration of a solution to this problem. With most devices relying on physical contact or verbal interaction, there is much untapped potential in a world where gesturing is one of the primary means of human communication. This invention could be particularly useful to those individuals who struggle with verbal communication but is also quite applicable to the everyday user.

What it does

Our program reads and processes visual input provided by the Leap Motion sensor, and compares that to a collection of user-trained gestures. It then translates the input into simple phrases to interact with a simulated home automation system.

How we built it

We wrote the gesture detection program with the Leap Motion SDK in C++. We configured this program to simulate requests to our home automation server, hosted on a separate machine running in python code, which we also wrote. The simple home automation simulation frontend is written in HTML5 with JavaScript and WebSockets.

Challenges we ran into

It was particularly difficult to implement the gesture database and recognition algorithm. We struggled with specific problems such as complex memory management in the low-level SDK, accurate comparisons in real 3-space, and properly saving and loading the database without corruption.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

We're proud of the interface that allows users to calibrate and train the device with ease, as well as the overall functionality of our project. Additionally, our dynamic command management system is an exciting and useful feature.

What we learned

We learned a ton about C++ design and management, including operator overloading. Processing, storing and comparing 3-D vector data from the device was much more complex than we had anticipated.

What's next for Hand Gesture Home Assistant

We would like to improve the user training interface to use a GUI rather than a CLI, and would also like to improve the accuracy of our gesture recognition to allow free rotation of gestures.

Naive clickthrough clusters,https://hackcuv.devpost.com/submissions/113961-naive-clickthrough-clusters,"Inspiration

We love data and we love python so this was a wonderful challenge!

What it does

We have written a set of both functions and organized descriptive code notebooks that parse the medium-sized OppenheimerFund website clickthrough dataset, analyze aspects of its behavior, and provide some options for clustering the data to allow for better classification and prediction of user behavior.

How I built it

The data was provided in a python dataframe, so the pandas python library was a natural choice for manipulating and analyzing the data. Visualizations of the data were performed using Matplotlib, clustering was perform using K-means clustering from the scikit library, and all organization decisions and analysis were performed by us!

Challenges I ran into

While the dataset was only medium-sized it was still large enough to caused many operations to require very noticeable processing delays. Additionally, we had no prior experience working with this type of data before so understanding how to properly organize it was a fun challenge!

Accomplishments that I'm proud of

We were successful at manipulating the data to reveal some of its behavior.

What I learned

We put significant effort into figuring out how to ask complex questions of the data, but probably focused too much time on answering these questons rather than working on techniques for visualizing the data. 

What's next for Naive clickthrough clusters

Given more time we would have developed visualizations of the data clustering. It would have also been nice to finish our experiments with using markov processes to more fully analyze correlation between successive events.

Hack U Knight (CyberHack Game),https://hackcuv.devpost.com/submissions/113965-hack-u-knight-cyberhack-game,"Inspiration

We really liked the powerpoint about how cybersecurity is underrepresented. David is currently taking a cyber security class and the rest of us are interested.

What it does

Our game is a top-down 2D puzzle game. The goal of the game is to use hacking and cryptography concepts to get your way to the end. We've structured the levels so that each room teaches a different concept. We really wanted to emphasize that the game was a fun learning experience, not a lecture or a tutorial with blocks of text. Our puzzles are designed to have the student realize how each concept works at a base level and experiencing each concept by trying to solve said puzzles. The concepts we cover are Brute Force, Dictionary Attacks, Caesar cipher, Crypto Analytic attack, and Binary Decryption.

How we built it

Caffeine. Lots of it.

We built the game from scratch. Most of us had never used Unity before and the one person who did has never made a top-down 2d game. Many of the art assets were premade or imported. We created all the scripts and mechanics from scratch, Matt worked mainly on the beautiful dialogue system and worked to make sure that the entire system flowed seamlessly. David knew the most about cryptography and worked in getting the concepts into the game and event triggers. Andrew worked on designing the analog puzzle and designed and built the entire circuit. Eric did basic movement mechanics and level design, animation, and event triggering. The entire thing was a huge collaborative effort and a lot of mistakes and learning were done. In the end, we are incredibly proud of our final product!

Challenges we ran into

3 out of 4 of our team members had never touched Unity or c# before ever! Learning to program in the language on a completely alien platform was a challenge when we started. The first 4 hours of this hackathon was spent downloading unity, troubleshooting unity, and learning basic Unity functionality. 

We also tried really hard to incorporate a hardware portion to our project, showing that these very cyber-focused concepts could be applied in real life. None of us are electrical engineers but we were able to create a small circuit system that uses logic gates to represent binary and this aids in solving one of our puzzles!

Accomplishments that we're proud of

Learning Unity and C# in a very short span of time. Creating a game in the span of 24 hours. Creating a circuit board that demonstrates uses of cryptography in an analog setting using logic gates. Pulling an all-nighter (totally worth it). Collaborating on one project and not running into too many merge issues. Actually finishing a La Croix (not worth it). 

Creating a truly fun and educational game that adheres to the bounds of the challenge given.

What we learned

Circuits are super hard. Drawing them is hard, making them work is even harder. But they're super rewarding when they work.

Unity and C#. Public variables are not as good as protected variables. Use prefabs when using an object repeatedly. Crunch time means functionality comes first, but don't let that deteriorate the quality of what you do.
Lime La Croix still isn't good.

What's next for Hack U Knight (CyberHack Game)

Scaling level difficulty (both conceptually and mechanically) that includes more interaction, contact with ""real"" programming, much more complex encryption methods, etc. We also would like to add a much deeper storyline including but not limited to a physical antagonist that the student has to battle against using the encryption method that they've learned. We want to be able to convey these concepts clearly in as fun of a way possible!

Bike Along,https://hackcuv.devpost.com/submissions/113966-bike-along,"Inspiration

We want to build a technology that encourages kids to go out and ride their bikes more. We believe that parents today aren't comfortable with their kids going out and biking without supervision, so kids are limited to biking when a parent is available.

What it does

This project consists of 2 apps: one for the parent and one for the child.

The parent's app provides an interface to plan a bike route for their child. The app displays the child's location in real time and sends a notification to the parent if the child deviates from the established route.

The child's app consists of a map (with the planned route plotted) and a panic button. If the panic button is pressed the parent's app is notified of an emergency.

Both apps communicate with a server, which makes sure the child stays on the planned route and notifies the parent otherwise.

How we built it

For both the parent and child apps, we used ReactJS for the front-end. The child app polls for GPS coordinates and posts them to a server. The server determines if the child is still on the planned route and notifies the parent app if not.

Challenges we ran into

We ran into problems deploying to the server.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

We got real-time location tracking using GPS to work. We also got the Google Maps Directions API to give us textual directions for processing.

What we learned

Boskin learned about ReactJS and various dependency managers (NPM and Yarn).

What's next for Bike Along

We want to polish the user interface more and make the navigation directions on the child app more kid-friendly.

HappyBiking,https://hackcuv.devpost.com/submissions/113968-happybiking,"Inspiration

To help children enjoy biking while going to school or anywhere else. Thus creating a pleasant experience for the student while riding and also giving an urge to go out to do some physical exercise. 

What it does

The students can start a app from their android mobile before they start from their source location and then while the student is on the road, the letters of English alphabets gets collected in the app according to the time and location the student is travelling. Once the student has reached the destination location, he can use the collected letters to make as many words as possible and improve their English skills. This creates an interest in the student to ride more and to learn more eventually. And finally when the student submits the answer, the answer are compared with a text file in the student mobile which is a dictionary.txt which contains all the dictionary word in it and gives out the score of the student as well. Hence he can improve further. 

How we built it

We built it using android studio app and basically created 3 activities to implement the above mentioned functionalities. 

Challenges we ran into

In the above app we tried to integrate the google maps API to improve it much further but it was a tough job and hence for now we excluded that feature and implemented the rest in our app. For now the words are calculated using the time period the student is riding. 

Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud that we implemented most of what we had in mind about the app.

What we learned

We learned to integrate API's into mobile app but couldn't combine that integrated API with our main app. We also learnt a lot more about how the mobile application is function as we coded through the activities in our app. 

What's next for HappyBiking

-> We are planning to implement the google maps API and also to integrate one more feature which will help the parents know the students location if they send a message to the students mobile. 

-> For the parent app part, once the parent sends a message, automatically the google map location link(GPS based, if GPS is not working, the network is accessed) from the kids mobile is sent as a text message to the parents without the student's need to access the mobile. 

-> We plan to add this feature that we have already and add the google API and do further improvements to it. One more thing we can add to the app is that check whether the student is originally riding from the source to the destination or not. And if the student tries to use the mobile while riding or inbetween, we can cancel the game for the student during that ride.

-> We can also create a student class community to improve the usage and learning experience in classrooms. Biking leaderboard can also be created eventually.

Our inspiration was when we were trying to figure out what to do for our project, and we saw a pen. And we wondered, what if it was an IoT pen?

What it does

Through text messaging using Twilio and some Twitter functionality, we can make the pen click itself using a Dragonboard and an Arduino.

How we built it

We used a Dragonboard to run a server that we used to parse SMS commands that either communicates with an Arduino that controls the servo that clicks the pen or interfaces with other apps. 

Challenges we ran into

The Dragonboard doesn't have a PWM pin, which meant we had to also use an Arduino to be able to connect to the servo. We tried to incorporate Fitbit GPS functionality but quickly realized that it was very difficult to get the information from the Fitbit without using the Fitbit companion app, which we didn't want to use. We also tried to incorporate Alexa functionality but it was very difficult trying to register our Dragonboard as an Amazon IoT device. We had issues using OAuth to connect to other users with one Twitter Developer account. The Python dependencies weren't installed on the Dragonboard, which caused us some problems. It was also difficult to make the pen structurally strong enough to be able to handle multiple clicks without moving out of place.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

We made a pen that successfully clicks itself. We were able to incorporate Twilio as well so that we could click the pen using texting features, which also allowed us to use Google Assistant to control the pen using Google Routines. We were also able to tweet using the pen without accessing the Twitter app.

What we learned

We learned about various API's, such as Twilio, Twitter, Fitbit, and Amazon Alexa. We also learned how to use a Dragonboard to run our server.

Run n Hike Monitor,https://hackcuv.devpost.com/submissions/113974-run-n-hike-monitor,"Inspiration:

Being a group of enthusiastic runners and trail aficionados, path tracking at regions without network connectivity was an important issue to us, we ended up brainstorming to solution to develop a 'run/hike tracker' which would still give you an exact path travelled without the need of live network connectivity. 

What it does

This project creates a way for a user to track the path he travels especially in areas where there is no mobile network which can be used to access internet and Google Maps consequently. This project allows the user to track the path he traversed using the GPS module which is present inside smartphone itself. Smartphone is a utility that every person carries so it is also one of the most suitable devices for such an application to be made. The android application developed in MIT App Inventor allows the user to to start and end his trip and the data collected by the GPS module working offline in that trip duration will be used to create a trajectory of the path the user took.

To keep the latitude and longitude locations taken by the GPS module, we have used Firebase by Google which is a real time database. We have implemented a ���Send Data�۝ button which the user can use to send the recorded GPS data over internet when he gets back in the network zone. After all the latitude and longitude locations are updated on Firebase, the user will be able to view his trip path on Google Maps by running a python program. The program fetches the Firebase data and uses that to point the exact locations where the user went. Our program also has the functionality of tracing the path using those points and show that on Google Maps.

Challenges we ran into


Google map APIs usage
Removing app local data
Interfacing google-map APIs with python


Accomplishments that we're proud of


Precise tracking using mobile GPS
Calculation of distance and speed.
Well-designed mobile application.
Usage of Google-map APIs


What we learned

We learned the working of GPS, Google Maps API and creating Android applications!

What's next for Smart Runner

Next updates for the Smart Runner include interfacing Altitude sensor from mobile phone to the app and Google maps. Also, make a 3D view of the total run or hike for a cooler app interface. Adding pictures and videos linked to different locations on the run or hike will add an immersive experience to it and make a sweet memory with the run/hike.

Binary Boy!,https://hackcuv.devpost.com/submissions/113975-binary-boy,"Summary:

Binary boy�۪s computer has been infected by a hacker! In order to save his data the user must help Binary Boy to stop the attack and find the hacker who has infected him. Along the way Binary boy must make use of multiple information security and cryptographic tools and techniques to take back his computer and reveal the hacker. 

Theme/Genre

Binary boy is a story based game that follows a series of mini games each teaching an unique cybersecurity topic. The game follows an overarching plot that outlines how a cyber attack may take place. This game takes place on Binary Boys computer, and each level takes the user to a new part of the computer. Thwarting the attack introduced in each game leads the user to more clues on how to stop the hacker.

Audience

The target audience of the game is elementary and middle school students. The game�۪s objective it to familiarize the player with cyber security terms and techniques without going into too many details. However, the difficulty of each challenge and the dialog can easily be scaled to a high school level.

Game Flow Summary

The user begins inside his home computer when he notices he is under attack. Binary boy�۪s first task is to take down the adware viruses using his binary blaster. After completing this, he continues on an adventure, learning about cryptography and cyber security, and . Subsequent levels continue to cover various security attacks and protective measures. 

Educational Design

Learning Objectives

The goal of the game is to introduce the user to a variety of cyber security terms and techniques. While there is no code involved, each mini games provides a unique perspective into a computer�۪s security structure and simulates how each attack might take place. Throughout the game the player is introduced to adware, unsecure connections, DDoS attacks, phishing, SQL injection, and ransomware.

Puzzle/Challenge Structure

The game is segregated into mini-levels, each levels content and gameplay difficulty progresses as the games continues. 

Play Flow

Each mini level contains a unique type of game play, include first person shooter, drag and drop, speed typing and strategy. The user is guided through each level until and prompted with instruction upon the start of a new level. 

Storyline

Setting

The game takes place inside of Binary Boy�۪s computer on the world wide web! The character is able to navigate all throughout his computer and can even travel to neighboring servers by surfing the web. The user will face challenges in the file system, motherboard, and at the router level. 

Characters

The game follows the adventures of Binary Boy. This is the play who the user controls through the game. Along the way the user will face a narrator and various enemies but no other primary characters. 

Visuals

Binary Boy was developed using GameMaker Studio (Game Maker Language). The player�۪s avatar is created using sprite sheets and other 2D graphics.  

Challenges

We only had free trial versions of GameMaker, which made development difficult. It was also hard to finish all of the content on time, as there are a lot of levels.

What we learned

2 of us had never used GameMaker before, so we spent a lot of time learning the software and IDE. Additionally, we learned how to plan out individual levels of a story game and relate them to educating young students.

Future Extension

There are many additions that can be made to this game prototype. For example space was left for a level simulating breaking through a user authentication protocol into the hackers desktop. There would also be efforts made to streamline the user interface and to add audio to the game. For the DDoS level extra functionality can be added too that will slow down Binary Boy as more packages damage either him or the server. Finally, there are levels with user input in the game that could be extended to teach about buffer overflow and sql injections.

Social Engineering Wargames Site,https://hackcuv.devpost.com/submissions/113978-social-engineering-wargames-site,"Team name: Social Re-engineers

Inspiration

Sites like hackthissite, overthewire, and smashthestack and a lack of social engineering based wargames or wargame sites.

Summary

A website hosting multiple self-contained hacking wargame style challenges or challenge sets. Each designed to teach various concepts and methods used in social engineering and to raise awareness in the recognition of when social engineering is being used. (Currently a work in progress but planning on developing long term outside of this hackathon).

Educational Design

Learning Objectives


Learn various concepts/methods in social engineering.
Learn ways people can leverage info on targets.
Learn how interconnected personal information can be.
Learn the potential consequences of releasing seemingly innocuous info to the public.
Better prepare players to approach interactions (especially online interactions) with others with caution and critical thinking.


Puzzle/Challenge Structure


The website will consist of multiple challenges/missions for the player to go through under different collections of games grouped based on the core concepts they aim to teach, and organized in ascending order by difficulty.
Current games: recon & dialogue and social engineering capture the flag.


Recon & Dialogue - The player will go through a simulation of gaining access to the online bank account of a fictional character named Alexander Coleman. Will consist of 4 parts:


Finding a username from one of the social media sites of the mark. 
Gathering key information on the mark such as likes, dislikes, residence, the schools they attended, etc.
Actually interacting with person. This will be done through dialogue trees.
Combing all of the info gained from steps 1-3 and logging into the mark's bank account through a password reset answering a security question.

Social Engineering CTF - The player must call someone, strike up a conversation, and get the person to answer questions from a provided list. Will have multiple lists at different challenge levels.



Play Flow


Players will select a category of game, and then select a game based on difficulty, being able to start at or change to whatever level they feel comfortable with, ideally working their way up the difficulty ladder.


Storyline


Each game will have it's own context, with some having storylines and others simply being fun tasks:


Recon & Dialogue (work in progress): You are up and coming in the online grifting scene and are tasked with obtaining the banking info of a person named Alexander Coleman. We created accounts for him on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram for use with this game.
Social Engineering CTF: Currently no story.

kindaRandom,https://hackcuv.devpost.com/submissions/113979-kindarandom,"Inspiration

We started to create a cybersecurity game, but abandoned it out of boredom. We then just started to brainstorm weird ideas we could do. Our next thought was to have the computer play telephone with itself, but the speech-to-text library we used was hard to implement on all our computers, and worked too well to introduce enough error to make the outcome interesting. We ended up just trying to do whatever, and ended up doing some webscraping and implementing the Twilio API.

What it does

The start of the game is an intentionally bad UI made in pygame. It has 3 buttons when it loads.
The first scrapes thispersondoesnotexist.com to get a random face and set the background of the game to that image.
The second scrapes the web for a random quote and then uses text to speech to say the quote, then uses the Twilio API to call one of our team members and say the quote.
The third exits the program.

How we built it

Python libraries and the Twilio API.
Lots of trial and error.

Challenges we ran into

Finding ideas for our project,
Libraries for text to speech didn't work cross-platform,
learning the Twilio API,
learning flask.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

We're glad the end result works as well as it does, even if the front end isn't impressive.

What we learned

PyVideoMusicifier,https://hackcuv.devpost.com/submissions/113980-pyvideomusicifier,"PyVideoMusicifier

Procedurally Generated Music Videos

PyVideoMusicifier is an application that converts arbitrary input video
into a music video based on the accompanying song.

How Does It Work?

There are two main processing techniques used in PyVideoMusicifier,
fourier analysis and beat detection.

Fourier Analysis

Fourier analysis allows us to look at the spectral content of the video.
From this spectral content we can figure out what the maximum magnitude
of all the peaks are. From this magnitude we can adjust the brightness
of the video to correspond.

The Fourier transform is also directly visualized in the video. After
sampling the transform, the samples are overlayed on the vignette. This
allows certain musical effects to be seen as well as heard.

Beat Detection

Beat detection allows us to figure out at what timestamps beats occur in
the target audio file. From this list of timestamps we can grow and
shrink the vignette effect that is overlaying the video.

WheresMySat,https://hackcuv.devpost.com/submissions/113984-wheresmysat,"WheresMySat

During the hackathon, we developed satellite orbit determination software keeping in mind accessibility, flexibility, and reusability.

First off, orbit determination allows engineers and scientists to identify where artificial bodies or natural celestial bodies are. Satellite orbit determination serves a wide range of purposes from allowing GPS users to calculate their own position on Earth to keeping tabs on deep space missions. Orbit determination algorithms input a-priori information and measurements of the object whose orbit is to be determined. We use a classical Kalman filter which is a sequential orbit determination algorithm which is able to provide an estimate of where a satellite will be by propagating an initial estimate forward according to system dynamics and updating that estimate each time it receives a measurement according to how ""confident"" the filter is in its own estimate and how ""confident"" the measurements themselves are.

We created a front end in order to present estimates of where a satellite is in order to make our software accessible. Our front end provides real-time solutions and diagnostics, allowing anyone to use the software, making orbit determination accessible to those who are not experts.

In order to address flexibility and reusability, we implemented automatic differentiation in our filter. In different orbit determination problems, states to be estimated and system dynamics vary. Within the filter, we must take partial derivatives of the system dynamics with respect to the states to be estimated which means that setting up each orbit determination problem can be time intensive if we take these partial derivatives numerically or set up analytical expressions to evaluate them. In our project, we implement automatic differentiation which allows us to input any amount of states without resetting the partials.

We set up a python web server to listen for simulated (or real) measurement inputs, which then ran the Kalman filter methods and estimated the state of the satellite at that time. This state was then pushed to an Influx database hosted on another computer, which displayed the data using a real-time updating graphical library.

HappyBot is a platform that identifies and engages with young people with depression and suicidal tendencies. Our goal is to contribute to the 1,400,000 suicide attempts in 2017 only in the U.S never be repeated, acting proactively preventing announced tragedies. 

After working in projects with the community in general, we have noticed that young people between 15 and 20 years age in active school life do not share their feelings with relatives and friends, but they use the internet as an outlet. The result is an immense accumulation of relevant information about the youth's personality, which simply is not used. 

How HappyBot Works
HappyBot will apply AI in Twitter's data to identify if these individuals are going through put their own life in risk. The AI will extract relevant information from tweets, such as:


Emotional range
Entities
Keywords
Sentiment analysis


How I built it

Once identified, HappyBot will contact these individuals through Chabot conversations, suggesting alternative treatments according to the person's preferences, focused on healthy living practices (community groups, volunteer jobs, practicing sports, etc.)

The Specialized Foundation is heavily invested in increasing accessibility to cycling to aid youth in personal development and education. While they specifically research the effect of cycling with kids who have ADHD, they believe that riding a bike can positively impact anyone's brain. 

Thus, it was our goal to create a platform that would encourage kids to ride their bike as a way to develop healthy habits and have fun. SPO specifically creates a cycling relationship between a parent and their child, in which the parent can set bounds on where the child rides, keep track of their location and motivate them to play outdoors.

The child portal in the app provides limited information (proximity and direction) about where local ""waypoints"" are - bike-centric places that a kid finds their way to as a way to complete a challenge. Either individually or with a group, kids can use the app and plan their own routes to waypoints and earn badges when they arrive at the location. 

Parents have the ability to set a home location in which their child's travel radius is centered around. They also have the ability to modify the size of the travel radius. The travel radius works as a fixed location parameter in which the parent is alerted if the child leaves the circle as a safety measure. 

Challenges we ran into

We wanted this app to be available across all platforms, so we used Flutter, which utilizes Dart, as a way to develop our app. However, none of our team members were experienced with any kind of app development, and only one had played with Flutter before. 

The learning curve for Dart and Flutter was extremely steep and were the cause of the majority of challenges. The Android studio and SDK proved difficult to install, and one teammate wasn't able to utilize the Android Debug Bridge for a couple of hours. We also had to convert map coordinates to bearings in order to get the direction and distance from our given waypoints. This proved challenging in finding the correct equations for the conversion. We also discovered a documentation error in one of the Flutter libraries that prevented us from using the location library, so we rewrote the function onLocationChanged with the correct parameters. 

Future Implications

As riders ourselves, we understand that learning new skills and excelling at them is one of the most fun parts of riding bikes. We would love to encourage kids to learn new tricks like riding with no hands, learning to wheelie, or riding pump tracks. In the future, we would incorporate accelerometers, gyroscopes, and pressure sensors and preset positional changes that indicate if the rider is doing a specific trick. Riders could earn points for doing certain tricks for a certain amount of time.

The Eliminator Game,https://hackcuv.devpost.com/submissions/113993-the-eliminator-game,"The Eliminator Game:
The Eliminator is a C++ text-based game aims to teach K-12 students about cyber risks and the importance of copyrights. The Player will own the copyright of episodes of TV show. If the player lost, he will be eliminated from the game. during the game the player will have to solve a puzzle in order to perform some actions. The puzzle is set of questions related to cyber risks that  K-12 students might face.

Where the idea came from :
Since a lot of K-12 students enjoy watching show series. We built The Eliminator games interestingly by incorporate those TV shows, in which the player choose whether to buy the copyright of the show and whether to sell it during his/her moves. 

How to run the game: 
You can run the game using the terminal or any C++ IDE. If you are using and IDE, you will need to incomment the include .cpp file on the start of the main.cpp code. 

How to play the game:
1-the player will start with $2000.
2- `the player should roll the dice and the dice has six sides (1-6).
3- He/she will move depending on what the dice rolled.
4- if the player passes by go he/she will earn $200. 
5- if an action card appeared the player will either lose or win money 
6- The player has the option to buy an episode if he/she is on that episode spot.
7- The player has the option to sell the copyright of the episode back to the bank. 
8- If the player wants to rent an episode from another player, he/she has to pay a fee(the fee depends on how many cards from the same set the owner has).
