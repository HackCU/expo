Best usage of Typeform APIs,PartyLink,https://hackcuv.devpost.com/submissions/113493-partylink,"Inspiration

Party Registration at college campuses right now is a tedious process, students are required to physically go to some department just so they can register their party which is why most students don't do it. We wanted to create an app that solves this, students can verify their status using their .edu emails at their campuses to prove that they're students. 

What It Does

Students use this to register their parties, college campuses can use this to keep track of all the parties occurring and to ensure everyone's safety. Other students can also find registered parties and RSVP.

How We Built It

Our team used NodeJS.Ngrok (server side) as well as Javascript as the primary language. We used HTML/CSS to create the front end.

Challenges We Ran Into


Linking mongoDB with typeform
Retrieving data from our databases and displaying it on our HTML Page.
Restricting features we wanted to add due to the time constraint


Accomplishments That We Are Proud Of


Successfully logging data into our database using typeforms
Hosting our HTML pages and having them redirect properly
Implementing a minimalist design to keep the user experience simple and to the point
Working as a team to solve issues


What We Learned


Greater understanding of databases
Additional experience in HTML/CSS, Javascript, NodeJS, and React


What's Next For PartyLink

Has potential to include APIs for some features. We originally wanted to include a map pin pointing all on/off campus student parties and also to add Snapchat Bitmoji integration but time was limited. There is also lots of room to expand communications with users of the application and their Universities.

Inspiration

Connect and Create: 
Out there is a programmer who develops games in their free time, an artist who is an avid gamer, and a composer-producer who has always wanted to work on a game. Or a singer who wants art and video to go with their original song. Or someone who wants to construct a campaign complete with visuals to help illustrate their worthy cause. CreateHUB intends to bring together these creators and connect them on like-minded projects in both the amateur and professional scenes. 

The way creators currently come together involves investing time and interaction on sites such as Twitter, Instagram, ArtStation, SoundCloud, GitHub and a dose of luck in discovering a fellow creative who fits into their dream project. Even then, it is difficult to know whether or not someone would be willing and available to take on a project. CreateHUB's motivation is to cultivate a centralized space for singers, artists, programmers, video editors, composers, creators from all tracks to collaborate on projects like music, comics, videos, and games.

What it does

Provides a way for creators to explore potential projects in the marketplace and display a portfolio. Users can sign up using typeform.

How we built it

HTML/CSS, Javascript, typeform (signup), firebase as the database for user data and host for the web app, node packages, express, angular

Challenges we ran into

We were unfamiliar with using typeform and firebase so everything was a learning experience. Also, agreeing on an idea was difficult and time consuming.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

Building something and working with tools we've never used before. We're proud that we were able to pass data between typeform on the website and firebase. We really pushed ourselves by learning new things instead of sticking to what we already know.

Coolest Hack with Twilio,Distributed Multi User Dungeon,https://hackcuv.devpost.com/submissions/113510-distributed-multi-user-dungeon,"Inspiration

What it does

DMUD is a way to run any multi user text-based adventure including user made adventures. It supports any device including mobile, SMS, web, and desktop. DMUD is decentralized and uses the interplanetary filesystem (IPFS) to store data, rather than storing it on a central server. DMUD is a peer-to-peer system, again requiring no central server, little setup, and no specific network requirements.

How we built it

DMUD is built with Python. It uses the Twilio SMS API to connect players via text message and uses the Python IPFS bindings to store data in YAML format on the IPFS. 

Challenges we ran into

We learned that peer-to-peer libraries are finicky and require a specific network setup that we don't have access to at a hackathon. We also learned a lot about the pitfalls of object oriented design, especially with complex object interactions.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

"Design, Build or Break Cyber Games for K-12 Education",KRYPTIA,https://hackcuv.devpost.com/submissions/113512-kryptia,"Summary

KRYPTIA is a multiplayer competitive educational game for Android or IOS in which participants challenge each other to prove who is the one able to decipher hidden words quicker. The game allows the player to compete in Challenging Duels (1 vs 1) or participate in Grand Challenges (All vs All). This last one has an “Educational Challenge”, which allows a teacher to take control of a Grand Challenge mode, making children from the same class or school compete with each other under their teacher’s supervision. This works as a tool that empowers teachers  that want to introduce cybersecurity and cyphration to children in a fun and proactive way.

Game Objective

The objective of the game is to get the higher\st amount of points. When in a game, KRYPTIA will show the same 10 different questions to the users that are competing. Depending on the time needed to correctly answer each question, the times that you answered them wrong, and the position respect other users to answer each question, users will get more points. After everybody has answered all questions, points are displayed and winner (a podium of 3) is declared.

Storyline

You are a interstellar traveller in a world where something called Earth is the last turistic call. But there is a problem: as people from all over the galaxy gather there, nobody understands anybody. So, in order to understand what they are saying from this extremely interesting place called “Earth”, you need to decipher what they are saying! Gather some friends to join you in this planet, and try to find out who is the quicker decypher.

Learning Objectives

User Centered Objectives


Motivate children to independently learn basic encrypting skills
Teach children about US cybersecurity current situation and challenges.
Help teachers to teach basic mathematical conversions (alphabet, decimal, binary, hexadecimal) in a participative and enjoyable way.
Provide tools to teachers that want to rise cybersecurity awareness to their pupils.


Skills Learned by Users


Ability to make critical observations.
Extract important information and patterns.
Understand the basic cyphration techniques
Capability to solve abstract problems.


Challenges Structures

The users, during the game, will have to solve 10 “challenges”. Each challenge is a question that has to be answered. These questions fall in three different categories.


Category 1: determined before starting the match, sets the topic of the questions.
-- Examples: Food facts; Countries facts; Cybersecurity facts.
Category 2: determines if what has been coded is a sentence or a number. The solution to the sentence type will be a word. The solution to number types will be a number.
-- Examples Sentences: Uif dpmps pg uif topx? (The color of the snow?) Answer: White.
-- Examples Numbers: In 2040 (1939) started WWII. Answer: 1939.
Category 3:determines how the question is coded.


Game Flow

You load into the game with your username and your password.
When loaded, you can change your avatar.
In the main menu you can see:
    Start a new Game
    Enter a started game
    Continue playing a game you had already started
    See the progress in a game you have finished playing, but need to wait for other players
    See your stats.

When you start a new game, you can set three different game modes:


Duel Challenge: In this game mode you play a quick match of a random topic against a friend.
Kryptia Storm: In this game mode there is one person that designs one challenge and the other people join the room (up to 10 people). Then, asynchronously, people complete the 10 questions on the topic. The one with more points win.
Grand Challenge: (class mode) in this last game mode, the teacher can control all aspects of the challenge Controlling the 3 categories of each question, and even making its own ones! The point is that on that class they would have been taught how to solve it and the reward could be either a class ranking or the ones who finish can go to the playground so the faster you solve the challenge the more play time you get.


Scoring


500 points - 1 point per second left
100 points if you are first
80 points if you are second
60 points if you are third
-20 points if you are wrong
Maxim total points: 6000

"Design, Build or Break Cyber Games for K-12 Education",CyberHack (Demo),https://hackcuv.devpost.com/submissions/113580-cyberhack-demo,"Inspiration

The inspiration for this game primarily came from the series called ""Welcome To The Game."" These games had a unique way of implementing elements of computer science and programming into the mechanics of the game through randomly generated minigames in real time. The source of inspiration for the multiple choice section came from basic trivia style video games.

What it does

The basic rundown of the program starts with the reading functions that implement all the necessary variables to run the game and trivia from txt.files. This is run in the background and the user will not notice unless a txt.file is missing or corrupted. 
Then it displays the first menu options: Start a new game, Continue from a save file, Read the rules, or quit. The program is able to handle both starting from a new game and reading saved data from a save file and continuing from that savepoint. 
If you select a new game, you can select the difficulty, which determines the number of rounds to play. For each round, the game randomly selects a minigame and pulls a question from the database. 
Minigame one is Programmer, where the user is asked to type in the displayed code as shown and is rewarded points for full accuracy. Minigame two is Pop Quiz, which asks multiple choice questions on basic cybersecurity concepts.

How I built it

Every program starts with a concept, outline, and/or pseudocode. I start with determining what are the end goals of the program and what variables are needed throughout the function. Since I wanted to develop the functions for reading and writing save files, I had to design multiple functions and an organized system to handle and store the necessary variables to be accessed or changed at any time. Then, I started with the implementation of a class to organize and run all the functions and the driver to start the game running process. Afterward, I slowly worked each function associated with a different section of the game mechanics and rigorously tested every new function before proceeding to the next.

Challenges I ran into

I had 3 main challenges to overcome during the project.
The first was both using the getline functions to read in the data from the txt.files correctly. I'm not sure how it's possible to get a stoi error from a getline function, but I did that unintentionally, multiple times. Even when getline was working, then I had issues afterward storing the data in the right locations.

The second was linked list implementation for the data of multiple choice minigame. It was either a linked list or some form of a 3D array, which I can only assume would cause more disasters than I experienced with the linked list. It was primarily syntax and segfaults errors when trying to access the data from the linked lists that ultimately lead to a restructure of the minigame functions.

The last problem was my getter and setter functions for the minigame questions. The intention of these functions was to store the question string or it's index number after it was already answered as a way of avoiding duplicates in the same game. Despite my best efforts and multiple versions of these functions, if you play the game enough times, every now then you'll still see a duplicate question in the same playthrough. It occurs with a higher chance when the player continues from a saved file.

Accomplishments that I'm proud of

Despite some minor imperfections, I'm proud that I achieved creating a working demo of a game I designed on a solo team. I'm happy with the organization and planning that went into it so that my time could be more focused on troubleshooting and debugging.

What I learned

While ambition is great, I learned to not be too ambitious and know my limitations. There were ideas for more minigames, a surplus of trivia questions, even implementing some version of a real-time coding section where the player had to code the displayed text within a certain frame of time. Time was most certainly the biggest factor and at times, while I would have liked to program more complex functions and game mechanics, I did have to settle for simplicity for the sake of moving forward and finishing a working demo. Lastly, a couple last minor lessons were converting integers into strings and re-learning how to cin a string that counts spaces. 

What's next for CyberHack (Demo)

Well, the first step would be to look back at those getter and setter functions for the minigame questions and work out a new solution that fixes the issues mentioned above. Afterward, I would consider what other minigames I can implement that kids would enjoy while also educating them on cybersecurity. Lastly, I would most likely modify this code to run into some sort of game engine or user interface program to make it visually appealing as opposing to just staring text in a terminal screen the whole time. I've been told by a friend that the Unreal Engine runs on C++, so that's worth investigating for future projects.

MLH: Best use of Google Cloud Platform,MLocation,https://hackcuv.devpost.com/submissions/113587-mlocation,"Inspiration

Our primary inspiration was the benefits this kind of technology could have on the general public. One benefit is for those who lose their technology very often. For example, the loss of a laptop or phone can be debilitating, especially in today's society. However, by using a network of interconnected nodes, we can find a registered device with ease.

What it does

Determines the precise location of a MAC address identified device by determining its distance from 3 or more locating devices (similar function to antennae).

How we built it

Using the monitor mode of network interfaces, we were able to determine the signal strength between devices in the area and an ""antenna"". After finding the strength for each device, we found the distance this signal strength correlated with. Using our triangulation algorithm, we were able to then pinpoint the exact location of the device, considering the placement of our ""antennae"". We then uploaded this data to our Google Cloud Platform (GCP) server and displayed the devices in a birds-eye view of the current room.

Challenges we ran into

Perhaps the biggest challenge we ran into was with our original idea. We originally planned to have a Raspberry Pi function as an antenna, decreasing the size and increasing the simplicity of our design. However, we learned much later that the WiFi adapters we planned on using would not support this kind of functionality and that we would have to scrap the idea for our own computers with much more supported internet cards.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

Accuracy

What we learned

We learned that USB WiFi adapters are no substitute for the internal WiFi cards already enclosed within our other computers.

What's next for MLocation

We plan on using WiFi adapters that are supported with Raspberry Pis as well as implement other methods of determining a location (such as angle of arrival, time of arrival, and channel state information) in the future in order to fulfill our original vision.

Have you ever thought about what are you really eating? Maybe no. Are you too lazy for counting calories and for monitoring if you exceed the limit? Maybe yes. Here is where Food Lord borns. An application that allows you to take a picture and automagically know what are you gonna eat!

What it does

Our web app allows you to estimate how many calories and which ingredients there are in the picture that you sent to the application. In order to do that, you only have to create an account and then take a picture or upload an image.

We know that this magic process could have bad results or ingredients that there aren't in the given image. In order to solve that, we've added a feature that allows you to add and remove ingredients to the processed image.

Finally, the app will save this data (known as a report) and they will be available to check in the user dashboard, where you can have a quick look about how you have been eating during the current week.

How we built it

Frontend and backend are very different components connected by API requests.

At frontend, we can see a React application that uses the library Grommet in order to use the UI components and integrated into a Docker compose.

In the other side of the application, we have the backend which is implemented with Python 3.6+. For creating the API that allows the communication between the two components, we have used Flask and OpenAPI (connected themselves with Connexion library), also integrated with Docker compose.

The core of the application, which allows us to estimate the calories and ingredients of a given image, has been possible thanks to RapidAPI. Food Lord is using these three APIs:


Imagga: this API allows us to use a Computer vision segmentation model for tagging all the objects that we get from the image. We also filter these tags using a threshold of 0.35 (35%).
Recipe: this API allows for getting all the ingredients from a huge database. This permits us to filter the results that we got from Imagga Image Recognition API.
Nutritionix: this API allows us to get all the information related to calories. Given a list of ingredients, we can get an estimation of how many calories have those ingredients.


This aggregation of APIs (called Food Lord API) has been deployed and exposed in the RapidAPI Marketplace, where you can test with an Internet-accessible image URL.

All this system is finally deployed in a Google Cloud VM and hosted in a free .tk domain.

Challenges we ran into

Since we have never used the kind of technology we needed to do a deep research in order to find the APIs to use with RapidAPI. Also we have found some problems when we were coding the fronted because we used a new library for us – Grommet components.

However, the most challenging part was deploying the web in Google Cloud Platform since a lot of ports of the Wi-Fi were blocked.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud of the project that we built. We have developed all the web app faster than we actually expected so we can take special care of a good UX experience and reach the objectives that we have.

What we learned

We learned a lot using the RapidAPI and discovering the huge amount of APIs that we have at our disposal. Also, regarding the front-end part, we learned a lot using Grommet, which is a React library.

What's next for Food Lord

There are a lot of enhancements and next steps that Food Lord could have. But, for example, could be interesting to share the meals and their estimations with the user dietist so he/she could help the user to be even healthier.

Have you ever thought about what are you really eating? Maybe no. Are you too lazy for counting calories and for monitoring if you exceed the limit? Maybe yes. Here is where Food Lord borns. An application that allows you to take a picture and automagically know what are you gonna eat!

What it does

Our web app allows you to estimate how many calories and which ingredients there are in the picture that you sent to the application. In order to do that, you only have to create an account and then take a picture or upload an image.

We know that this magic process could have bad results or ingredients that there aren't in the given image. In order to solve that, we've added a feature that allows you to add and remove ingredients to the processed image.

Finally, the app will save this data (known as a report) and they will be available to check in the user dashboard, where you can have a quick look about how you have been eating during the current week.

How we built it

Frontend and backend are very different components connected by API requests.

At frontend, we can see a React application that uses the library Grommet in order to use the UI components and integrated into a Docker compose.

In the other side of the application, we have the backend which is implemented with Python 3.6+. For creating the API that allows the communication between the two components, we have used Flask and OpenAPI (connected themselves with Connexion library), also integrated with Docker compose.

Project for HackCU V by Sam Feig, Jay Hayward, and Mark Wilmes

We wanted to make a tool to help people learn about Cybersecurity Capture the Flag challenges and how to go about solving a few basic and fun ones! We also wanted to set up a way to host CTF competitions through the CU Cybersecurity Club and get more people involved in this amazing field. CTFHero creates a platform with a huge potential to help people who are just starting, as well as veterans,  learn and grow their skills in cybersecurity.

So go check it out! See what the hype is about and why cybersecurity is the next big thing!

We used Google Cloud to host the web server and manage the CTF sub-pages and a Domain.com domain to host the site. A Redis database houses the past challenges and the plan is to extend it to pull directly from ctftime.org for writeups from future competitions. We all improved our web development skills and learned more about Node.js and how it integrates inside a website. The plan is also to use the ""Compete"" section to run future CTFs for the CU Cybersecurity Club.

"Design, Build or Break Cyber Games for K-12 Education",Enigma,https://hackcuv.devpost.com/submissions/113751-enigma,"Inspiration

We designed and developed a Mystery Game for K-12 Cybersecurity Education.

What it does

It's a mystery game that tests the K-12 students' knowledge of cybersecurity. At each step, there are puzzles to be solved before they can go forward in the story.

How we built it

Mahshab created the storyline. Mahshab and Ghazaleh created the graphics in Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator. Ghazaleh, Sepideh and Maziyar worked on the Front End. Sepideh and Maziyar worked on the Backend and Cybersecurity questions.

Challenges we ran into

Dealing with flask; Animating page elements using Javascript; Connecting the story behind the pictures with the cybersecurity questions asked.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

Good story, good graphics, making it all work!

What we learned

We learned it's a challenging task to design for K-12, or in general, for people not in your generation.
We learned animating the page elements with JavaScript. We were challenged by and learned how to deal with flask and use python in it. 

What's next for Enigma

Completing the story (which is so interesting, but 24 hours was too short for its implementation).

"Design, Build or Break Cyber Games for K-12 Education",Firewall Fighter,https://hackcuv.devpost.com/submissions/113758-firewall-fighter,"Inspiration

The idea of teaching kids about cybersecurity at an early age got us thinking about when we first learned about anything related to cybersecurity. Among our earliest memories included learning about firewalls, but the way we were taught about it was both uninteresting and inaccurate in hindsight. The teacher would simply put an inaccurate diagram on the board and inform us that it ""blocked most of the traffic from our computers."" We felt that this model did not properly represent the amount of parsing and work a firewall must perform, and there must be a better way to teach students about this concept.

What it does

The player controls a small ball on screen with a leap motion. Traffic (red and green cubes) enter the top of the screen and exit through the bottom. The player must direct their ball into the red malicious cubes to prevent them from entering our network while allowing as many green cubes as possible to pass through. Sounds were added so that hitting a cube feels more like a real world action. The game also gets progressively harder as the game goes on as more cubes fall in the same time period.

How we built it

We used the leap motion detect and translate hand motions into an in-game action of moving a sphere around. The sphere is simply mapped to the movements of the palm of the right hand. This sphere is then used as the ""mouse"" on screen for the user. We then used simple unity c# scripts and objects to create the cubes that fall down the screen,  instructions, and a score.

Challenges we ran into

From the onset, we had a steep learning curve to learn C# and Unity which neither of us had used before. We managed to figure them both out pretty well, but we struggled to properly detect collisions between the hand object the leap automatically creates and other objects we create. In order to resolve this problem, we had to create a sphere that followed the hand around. Then, we could use this sphere to detect collisions with other objects. This made the coding much easier, but also made the controls easier too. The user does not have to see and try to comprehend a whole hand on the screen, they can simply just move one little ball around.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

We created a working prototype of the game we envisioned in the beginning.  We're also proud the game feels somewhat natural and fun to play.

What we learned

We taught ourselves how to use three new things (leap motion, Unity, c#).

What's next for Firewall Fighter

Our game could have a bit more explanation of the cyber-security principles.

Coolest Hack with Twilio,DebateMonkey,https://hackcuv.devpost.com/submissions/113779-debatemonkey,"Inspiration

I participated in debate in high school and still go back and judge tournaments and coach the students. I realized that the process of managing the tournament, most notably scheduling rounds, notifying competitors and maintaining results, was done in a very inefficient manner, mostly by hand. An online service does exist to provide this service, tabroom.com, but it does not have an extensive feature set, and its service is unreliable. Thats why we decided to make debate monkey, a tool to provide these service rapidly and reliably.

What it does

DebateMonkey is web service in which tournament officials can create tournaments so that students can join on their own accord. Once a tournament is created, any user with access can register for the tournament. DebateMonkey will automatically create matches and notify the students as to where their round is and who they are facing. It will also assign to judge to critique the round. Afterwards, the judge can enter their decision and comments to each team. After the judge submits this electronic ballot, DebateMonkey will automatically tabulate these matches to create finals qualifiers and overall placements. At the official's behest, the judges comments may be hidden or revealed to the competitors at whatever point. All of this functionality is available through the web interface or the app. If any students opt out of they app, they may also chose to receive notifications via SMS, using Twilio.

How I built it

The web frontend was built in ReactJS. The backend is a RESTful Django Framework, that manages a mySQL database to store all tournaments, users, and round results. The back end is responsible for tabulating the results and pushing notifications via Twilio or the App. The app was built using Flutter.

Challenges I ran into

Originally, we were a team of 4, but all of my team was forced to leave early in the HackCU tournament, leaving only me to work on the project. This resulted in this projected being far too large scale for a single person to handle. I decided to drop the app and focus mostly on the web interface. Also, I didn't have much time to focus on the styling and UX and had to focus on functionality leaving the site a little rough around the edges. The hardest technical challenges were serializing the many to many relationship with users and tournaments in the database using Django models and maintaining persistent login sessions utilizing authorization tokens. 

Accomplishments that I'm proud of

I managed to get a relatively functional site that encompasses the basic functionalities of my desired app while only having one person. The end product is still visually appealing and the UI is fairly intuitive. The Twilio API was successfully implemented and sends out a text message to a registered user.

What I learned

The technology I learned most about was Django and how to manage database models with it. I also learned how to implement the Twilio API, and also how to stay sane after 24 hours of coding alone.

What's next for DebateMonkey

Our next focus is going to be implementing the key elements that were missed, specifically ballot entry and judge enrollment. Some UI changes and overall bugfixes and I think debate monkey could be a viable product.

Best Beginner Hack,LocationTracer,https://hackcuv.devpost.com/submissions/113786-locationtracer,"Inspiration

Inspired by true social incidents and happenings across the world. in many countries such as egypt, moroco,india we experience a constant backlash on women and children such as sexual assualt, even in the most crowded or desserted places. this may even happen to our friends or family. 
we cannot always depend on police and the government in these kind of emergencies as these countries are few of the most corrupted and insecure places in the world. 
but we believe we can always depend on the technology we have and the ability of using it to solve real world problems. and also we can depend on friends and family. 

we developed a hack where we can get to know the location of a missing beloved ones or who we think can be in danger as soon as possible with exact longitude and latitude even when there is no access of INTERNET connectivity.

What it does

This is an app which enables users to identify their beloved ones if they are out of reach. This application sends an SMS to the person whose location we want to know. Then the sms invokes an Android application and that application fetches the latitude and longitude of the user. Then it embeds that data in a Google Maps URL and send it back as an SMS to the user who requested it.

How we built it

We built the entire project on Android Studio using JAVA. We have also Android SQLite Database to store the preferences of the users. 

Challenges we ran into

Access Control is the first challenge we ran into. No user would ever like to reveal his data to an anonymous person. He would like to limit the number of people who can know his location at any point of time. So, maintaining that access control was the first hurdle.
Getting the latitude and longitude values not null is the second hurdle we passed. We used a loop and kept changing the sources of GPS location(both Internet and GPS device) and when ever we get a valid data, we exit the loop.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

The main thing that we are proud is the application has amazing accuracy. It can detect an average of 5cm motion in the mobile phone. This application survived many extreme test case conditions. This is the fastest way to retrieve a users location without flooding. 

What we learned

We learnt the implementation of BroadcastReceiver in Android and also considering the extreme conditions while developing a software application.

What's next for LocationTracer

We are looking forward to implement geofencing in it so that we can have a device with the kids and get to know if they crossed our neighborhood. We also have a designing the UI in a more enhanced manner.

Game made with the purpose of educating middle school students about cyber-security in a fun and approachable way. It allows the player to explore the different cyber-security concepts as they solve puzzles to exit the room. 

It takes place in a room with different intractable stations. Each station is a computer, safe, or something similar and must be navigated using a command line built into the game. The player practices using some linux commands and solves puzzles related to crytographic concepts. The player must use all the clues to figure out the final password and escape the room.

MLH: Best use of Google Cloud Platform,Eddie,https://hackcuv.devpost.com/submissions/113802-eddie,"Inspiration

Google recently released a very similar feature for their Pixel phones. As an iPhone user I was jealous and wanted the same thing for my phone.

What it does

When I decline a call (or it's blocked) the call is redirected to a digital assistant which asks the caller who they are and why they're calling. That recording and transcript is then sent to my phone via push notification. After reviewing the message I can choose to have the call connected or send them to voicemail.

How I built it

The core code is written in JavaScript. The back-end is done with node.js and the front-end is a react-native app. Missed call forwarding setup varies by carrier, but for Verizon it is activated by dailing *71. The calls are forwarded to a Twilio phone number which is controlled by the back-end. After the message is recorded via Twilio the audio is send to Google Cloud's Speech Recognition API with the model set to phone_call.

Challenges I ran into

The primary challenge I ran into was figuring out how connect a Twilio phone number to receive calls for my actual number. It took a lot of research before I discovered the missed call forwarding feature (which I now understand that most carriers support).

Accomplishments that I'm proud of

I'm very proud that the whole system works and is genuinely useful.

What I learned

I learned how to use the Twilio phone call API and how to tunnel the react-native development server over USB.

What's next for Eddie

Clean up the code, implement multi-user support on the server, and then App Store release.

firstly we have copied the UI of facebook by downloading their source code and by getting registered into a onilne domain, then for the phishing , we redirected facebook login to our own php file.Now that we have users credentials, we navigate them to an ordinary website making sure the user doesn't doubt us.

Challenges we ran into

The main challenge we fought was dealing with development of a tool that has the ability to detect such websites. We had to try numerous machine learning models inorder to get the best accuracy.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

We have a whooping accuracy of 99.1% in detecting phishing websites and even implemented that in a python GUI application.

What we learned

We learned about developing Python GUI applications and some machine learning models.

"Kids + Bikes = happier, more attentive students in the classroom",Bike Ride Tracker,https://hackcuv.devpost.com/submissions/113829-bike-ride-tracker,"Inspiration

Allow kids to bike around and explore parks and other fun landmarks near them and earn points doing so.

What it does

Allows users to bike around and discover parks and other landmarks in boulder and earn points for each location discovered.

How I built it

Used dart and the flutter framework to create a mobile app for both ios and android. I also used the google maps api to create a dynamic map and add markers to the map which could be discovered by users.

Challenges I ran into

The original flutter plugin I wanted to use was broken which required a lot of time to get working properly. Along with that the original haversine plugin I was going to use did not work with the most recent version of Dart which caused me to have to recreate the plugin. 

Accomplishments that I'm proud of

Implemented google maps api

What I learned

How to use the location and maps plugin for flutter along with the haversine formula to calculate the distance between a user and a marked location.

What's next for Bike Ride Tracker

Use google places api to automatically create new places to explore!
Also finish implementation of the stats page to show the user where they have been and the number of points collected

Parking at the Colorado School of Mines is always a tricky task, so we decided to build a system to prevent the need to drive around looking for a parking place. 

What it does

RapidPark is a system of cameras stationed at entrances to parking lots that detects cars entering and leaving the parking lot. When a car is detected, it will update the current lot capacity on the heat-mapped google maps web application. The system updates in real-time, and uses fast computer-vision classification apis to take the images of the cars and detects aspects of them, such as license plates

Submission for Specialized's challenge. 
ADHD kids struggle in classrooms
Child obesity
Video game addiction
Fewer opportunities for kids to be outside
With an app that has snap chat integration, kids will be more inclined to use it. Everyone loves Snapchat.

What it does

Our app allows the gamification of biking to push kids to go outside. The app tracks your biking statistics to give you a score and level, to make physical activity more of a game. In addition, we implemented Snap Kit, adding Snapchat logins, Bitmojis, and allowing your game to be shared on Snapchat seamlessly. 91% of kids think Riding for Focus is a fun program, and 93% of kids would recommend it to a friend, and our application only further incentivizes this. 

How we built it

HTML, CSS, JS-Node, Cordova, Twist API, Swift, Xcode, Snap Kit Creative, Bitmoji, and Login.

Challenges we ran into

There were many problems using the Snap Kit SDK as it was very new. But once this was all figured out it was smooth sailing.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

What it does

Our program analyzes a given user profile's page and calculates interesting stats. For example, their most popular tweets and most popular followers

How we built it

We used Python as a back end, taking advantage of Tweepy and the Twitter API. From there, we used Flask to integrate our Python with the front end, which was comprised of HTML and JavaScript.

Challenges we ran into

Figuring out how to use the Twitter API at first was confusing at first. We spent a lot of time looking at references to see what we could do with it. Also, We ran into problems with connecting the front end HTML files and the back end Python code. We eventually settled on use Flask which is a Python based code that allows a seamless integration between Python code and HTML basics.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

This is our first hackathon as a team, so we are really proud of how our project ended up with this in consideration. It was jacob's first major program in python, and his first time ever using an API. Dylan and Conner are really proud of figuring out how to take Jacob's back end and connect it to a front end, as they have never done this before either. We had to make some compromises due to time and lack of experience, including not doing embedded tweets, but we believe it turned out pretty well. 

What we learned

Using the Twitter API, front end back end connection, and how fun hackathons are!

What's next for Twitter User Stats

We will probably work on minor improvements from here, possibly running outside of flask so that others can use the service without all the local files. Also, if we can figure out embedded tweets that would be great.

Best Beginner Hack,Twitter User Stats,https://hackcuv.devpost.com/submissions/113883-twitter-user-stats,"Inspiration

We were interested in working with the Twitter API, and thought it would be really interesting to see some general stats about certain profiles. 

What it does

Our program analyzes a given user profile's page and calculates interesting stats. For example, their most popular tweets and most popular followers

How we built it

We used Python as a back end, taking advantage of Tweepy and the Twitter API. From there, we used Flask to integrate our Python with the front end, which was comprised of HTML and JavaScript.

Splunk Challenge,Surf - Predictive Browsing Plugin,https://hackcuv.devpost.com/submissions/113885-surf-predictive-browsing-plugin,"#26

Inspiration

When thinking about how to use big data for good, we came up with the concept for Surf in order to help users understand their browsing habits and even make some common tasks quicker and easier.

What it does

Surf is a Chrome extension that intelligently suggests sites a user may want to visit based on browsing activity, such as browsing history, mouse movements, and user habits. At the top right of each site, users will see an unobtrusive list of suggestions for that site. By mousing over this bar at the top right, users will see an expanded list from which they can select their next destination

Surf also has a companion Android app that allows users to look at their browsing habits as well as access their most used links.

How we built it

The extension collects various metadata and uses a PageRank-style algorithm to determine a list of suggestions for each website a user visits, and this list changes dynamically as users continue to browse. It syncs this data to a Firebase database, which the companion app reads from.

Challenges we ran into


Generating/collecting test data to assist in modifying the algorithm was time-consuming
Hooking up the extension and app to Firebase complicated things considerably


Accomplishments that we're proud of

The extension is sleek and genuinely useful, and the android app provides interesting insights into user browsing habits.

What we learned

Building and testing something that's meant to handle lots of data is difficult to do quickly, and adding users and databases complicates things even more.

What's next for Surf - Predictive Browsing Plugin


Enhance algorithm by training a machine learning classifier (we need to collect more real data)
iOS companion app, Firefox/Safari/etc. extensions
More sophisticated user handling/login system
End-to-end encryption of user data, so we can't spy on users

MLH: Best Domain Registered with Domain.com,randomDomainName-Do Not Let Your Mom See This,https://hackcuv.devpost.com/submissions/113887-randomdomainname-do-not-let-your-mom-see-this,"Inspiration

When you are out on the internet, there are stuff that you don't necessarily want your parents, especially your mom to see...

What it does

Ideally, this website is going to be having feeds of random stuff that are not parents-appropriate.
But right now, it's just a random website that is rather appropriate for all-ages.

How I built it

I started with registering the domain name from domain.com, then i started to work on the webpage. I coded the html and css at first. Then I ran into the problem of animating the count-down effect on the 2nd page. So I asked for help on the mentor channel of Slack. Lauren Raddatz came over and helped a lot. After trials and errors of changing codes, switching css to scss and switching it back, We figured out achieving the desired result by modifying a code snippet of javascript online. So the whole webpage is then completed and ready to be published to the web. Then it came to the challenge of finding a web host for my site. I approached mentors on slack, got lots of great suggestions but at last decided to just use another github page to host the domain. Then it's the problem of figuring out how to link my githubpage _ xianglll.github.io_ with the domain name that i registerd link . I had to refer back to another website that I have, which is another domain purchsed from google domain but also hosted through github. The procedure was a bit confusing for the domain.com domain, because there are more than 15 of additional DNS records whose functions that I don't know of. I had to try out adding different methods of adding type A DNS records and even change out its nameservers on domain.com's end. Besides, I had to go back to github to adjust the codes: to rename the 1st page to be index.html, going into all the codes to fix the link to the images, since they are not at the same designated folder as what's been saved on my computer. After the tiny changes were made. It is now working properly on the designated [http://donotletyourmomseethis.com]

Accomplishments that I'm proud of

Having successfully hosted a domain through github. And the domain name is really cool, isn't it!

What I learned

Keep trying, keep googling, ask for help.
It's always GOOD to fail, because you'll then fix the error and the final product more polished and less breakable.
If the code doesn't work, but you think they should. Give it some moment and let the magic of codes do its thing. After... let's say 30min, hit refresh the page, and BOOM, maybe it'll be working now!

What's next for randomDomainName-Do Not Let Your Mom See This

It will be fun to keep working on it and actually turn it into a fun website with lots of feeds coming in, either generated by the users or crawled from the website or handselected. There should a mechanism to filter out the contents that are ""appropriate"".

MLH: Best Domain Registered with Domain.com,MLarketplace,https://hackcuv.devpost.com/submissions/113888-mlarketplace,"Inspiration

When a company is looking to enter the market of Machine Learning, their only real avenue of entry is to hire ML engineers.  This creates large barriers of entry for small businesses which cannot afford to spend millions on previously solved problems.

With MLarketplace we gather metrics on project use, and provide a simplified deployment process. So creators can use their expertise to create optimized and efficient solutions to common ML problems, which clients can then apply immediately to their own system.

What it does

MLarketplace is a website built on a flask server and mongoDB database in order to provide easy access to Machine Learning Solutions.  Developers can easily submit both pre-trained and un-trained projects to the database through a simple HTML form, and from there they have easy access to metrics on how their model is being used.  On the other hand, clients are met with project summaries including project name, developer name, and a readme describing the project.

If a project matches a user's needs, they can access the model using our MLarkeplace client library.  Which allows users to train models with their own proprietary data, use the pre-trained systems uploaded by developers, and most importantly, make predictions on their own system.

How we built it

MLarketplace is broken into three fundamental systems: the client side application where processing occurs, the server which stores our project information, and our library which works as the interface between the two.

Client Side: When a client requests a project from MLarketplace, that model is placed in a sandboxed process to protect both the client and developer's private information.  Each time a client asks a model to predict an answer or score it's accuracy, these usage metrics are passed-through to server counters.

Library: Each function on the database is required to operate on jsons to allow for language portability.  Clients can interface through each model's train, predict and score functions.  Train allows users to tailor models to their own application, predict attempts to extrapolate on a given test vector, and score takes known test vectors and classifications to provide easy accuracy calculations.

Server:  The server is built with flask and manages our mongoDB database. Each entry to the database stores developer information such as project and developer name, and  stores pointers to the model's true definitions and readme files.

Challenges we ran into

One of the major challenges we ran into was how to transport developer code without providing A) providing access to the source file to clients, and B) without putting undue strain on our database.  In order to resolve these problems we needed to both define external file systems and implement some basic sandboxing to prevent over-share of data.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

At the end of this hackathon we have created a solid proof of concept, which can interpret and distribute programs very efficiently and simply.

What we learned

This project involved a lot of web development, an area that none of us specialize in.  We have all gained a lot of experience working with flask servers and mongo databases, using forms to take input, and defining libraries to effectively distribute solutions.

What's next for MLarketplace

There are a couple areas that MLarketplace can benefit from continued development.  A more fully fleshed out user system would have to be created to allow for true enterprise solutions, as there is no account protection and verification currently implemented in the system.

Increasing our focus on security by finalizing the sandboxing of our client running systems.  This includes defining hard limits to processing power allowed to potentially malicious ""models"" and screening developer projects to ensure they meet our specifications.

We have laid the foundation for making MLarketplace truly language agnostic, but there is still work to be done in order achieve that goal.  In order to do this, we would have to transform out library into a server that allows for RestAPI requests.

"Design, Build or Break Cyber Games for K-12 Education",Cookie Injection but with Real Cookies,https://hackcuv.devpost.com/submissions/113889-cookie-injection-but-with-real-cookies,"Inspiration

We wanted to create a video game that taught the critical skills of the cybersecurity mindset to 3rd-6th graders. The cybersecurity industry is already lacking 300,000 jobs, an early introduction to the cybersecurity mindset will allow society to manage this need. 

What it does

We created both:
a. An example game to play through the first initial levels of our game using the Godot Engine.
b. A white paper on the principles we applied and a development plan for the future. This white paper goes into detail
the future game and level design as well as the cybersecurity learning objectives for each level.

How we built it

We used the Godot Engine to build all of the characters and levels, starting from an initial example stage of a platformer. All assets and code are 100% MIT Licensed or in the Public Domain. We developed our game with this as a priority because we find it incredibly important for schools benefit from this game as much as possible, including analyzing the source code and making improvements as needed. The game is runnable in basically every format: Web, Windows, Mac, and even Linux. This will greatly benefit distribution and adoption.

Challenges we ran into

Neither of us had ever made a game before, so we where learning as we went along. We spent a large amount of time on just getting the dialog box to appear, then even more time trying to get a button that had an image (plus or minus sign) as it's texture. Once we got over those roadblocks and started to figure out how Godot organized and controlled assets, it was much more smooth (choppy) sailing.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

That we have a game to show and a lot of development planning at the end of this! We are both really happy about the knowledge we gained about game design, from 0, to being able to make a basic app. I am also proud that we created something we feel could be actually impactful. Cybersecurity education and outreach is very important both of us.

What we learned

Don't underestimate the time it takes to do basic tasks and learn new advanced software, like a game engine. This was really time and energy intensive, which means we weren't able to create all the examples that we wanted too. We also learned to appreciate some of the abstractions a game development engine provides. Using one editor, we were able to export functional copies for (almost) any platform.

What's next for Cookie Injection but with Real Cookies

Hopefully, Circadence and TCP are interested in this project, and we can discuss what future development and deployment will look like!

MLH: Best use of Google Cloud Platform,Attention Monitor - Distracted Driving Solution,https://hackcuv.devpost.com/submissions/113916-attention-monitor-distracted-driving-solution,"Inspiration

A member of our team researched a report on motor vehicle safety from the CDC (Center for Disease Control and Prevention) for a project while in grade school. The report highlighted disturbing facts about distracted driving such as approximately 9 people are killed and more than 1,000 people are injured in crashes that involved a distracted driver. In 2015 alone, 391,000 people were injured in motor vehicle crashes, and 3,477 people were killed in crashes involving a distracted driver. ""Distracted driving is driving while doing another activity that takes your attention away from driving. Distracted driving can increase the chance of a motor vehicle crash"" (cdc.gov). Our team became very cognizant of the growing number of incidents and preventable accidents due to distracted driving, and decided to develop an attention monitoring system that could be utilized in several different use cases to monitor and encourage more deliberate engagement while driving a vehicle or operating equipment.

What it does

Our attention monitoring system intelligently monitors a user's head and pupil movement while driving to track when the user is distracted. According to the CDC, visual and cognitive distraction are two of the leading causes of distracted driving, and can lead to serious injuries and loss of life. Our team has imagined several different use cases and implementations of this technology. Attention monitoring and tracking can be used for insurance purposes to determine how engaged and safe drivers are. Other examples include monitoring pilots, bus drivers, equipment operators, and testing the focus of student drivers while participating in Drivers Education. All of the use cases build upon the foundation of attention monitoring and tracking, and can be implemented in different ways to accommodate each use case. When people are driving a car, flying a plane, or operating a piece of motor equipment, it is important that their attention stays on the task they are performing. Once people ""take their eyes off of the road"" and become distracted, injuries and fatal outcomes are significantly more likely to occur. Texting and driving is 6 times more likely to get someone in a car accident than drunk driving (icebike.org). The attention monitoring system provides a simple and effective solution to this preventable worriment by tracking the instances that an individual is distracted while driving/flying/operating. Our group has created a specific implementation of the attention monitoring solution designed for the use case of a parent overseeing the quality of their child's driving behavior.

How we built it

(NEED MORE INFO)
Our attention monitor solution and parent/child implementation was built using a Dell XPS 13 laptop running Linux, usb webcam, OpenCV, Twilio, RapidAPI, Google Cloud, and Github (MORE). The webcam is used to stream video into the laptop, and the laptop utilizes OpenCV to track the movement of the user's head and pupils. Custom defined thresholds define when a user is considered to be ""distracted."" For instance,  it takes approximately 5 seconds to complete a lane switch (semanticscholar.org), and taking one's eyes off the road long enough to read a text message takes the same amount of time (cdc.gov). That's enough time to cover a football field at 55mph. If the child is considered to be distracted for more than five consecutive seconds, then they are given one strike. After the child gains three strikes, a text message is sent to their parent using Twilio letting them know that their child has been quite distracted while driving. The parent can choose to reply to that automated alert in order to further action. In addition to this, the parent will be able to access an online portal with information including real-time coordinates of the child, real-time location-accurate weather, and (WHAT ELSE). 

Challenges we ran into

(WHAT CHALLENGES)

Accomplishments that we're proud of

Our team is proud of our collaboration, critical thinking, ingenuity, and the final product. Each one of us has a different technical background and expertise, and we were able to find a way to include everyone's expertise and work together through difficult challenges in order to create an attention monitoring system that tracks when a user is distracted while driving/flying/operating.

What we learned

Our team learned that coming across annoying challenges and bugs are typical to the development process. In addition to this, we expanded our experience in developing with APIs, Django, Geolocation, and SQL.

What's next for Attention Monitor

Our team wants to improve the image recognition system to recognize an individual's head and eyes in more challenging lighting conditions. We want to work on more custom implementations of the solution such as the Parent/Child driving scenario.

A member of our team researched a report on motor vehicle safety from the CDC (Center for Disease Control and Prevention) for a project while in grade school. The report highlighted disturbing facts about distracted driving such as approximately 9 people are killed and more than 1,000 people are injured in crashes that involved a distracted driver. In 2015 alone, 391,000 people were injured in motor vehicle crashes, and 3,477 people were killed in crashes involving a distracted driver. ""Distracted driving is driving while doing another activity that takes your attention away from driving. Distracted driving can increase the chance of a motor vehicle crash"" (cdc.gov). Our team became very cognizant of the growing number of incidents and preventable accidents due to distracted driving, and decided to develop an attention monitoring system that could be utilized in several different use cases to monitor and encourage more deliberate engagement while driving a vehicle or operating equipment.

What it does

Our attention monitoring system intelligently monitors a user's head and pupil movement while driving to track when the user is distracted. According to the CDC, visual and cognitive distraction are two of the leading causes of distracted driving, and can lead to serious injuries and loss of life. Our team has imagined several different use cases and implementations of this technology. Attention monitoring and tracking can be used for insurance purposes to determine how engaged and safe drivers are. Other examples include monitoring pilots, bus drivers, equipment operators, and testing the focus of student drivers while participating in Drivers Education. All of the use cases build upon the foundation of attention monitoring and tracking, and can be implemented in different ways to accommodate each use case. When people are driving a car, flying a plane, or operating a piece of motor equipment, it is important that their attention stays on the task they are performing. Once people ""take their eyes off of the road"" and become distracted, injuries and fatal outcomes are significantly more likely to occur. Texting and driving is 6 times more likely to get someone in a car accident than drunk driving (icebike.org). The attention monitoring system provides a simple and effective solution to this preventable worriment by tracking the instances that an individual is distracted while driving/flying/operating. Our group has created a specific implementation of the attention monitoring solution designed for the use case of a parent overseeing the quality of their child's driving behavior.

How we built it

(NEED MORE INFO)
Our attention monitor solution and parent/child implementation was built using a Dell XPS 13 laptop running Linux, usb webcam, OpenCV, Twilio, RapidAPI, Google Cloud, and Github (MORE). The webcam is used to stream video into the laptop, and the laptop utilizes OpenCV to track the movement of the user's head and pupils. Custom defined thresholds define when a user is considered to be ""distracted."" For instance,  it takes approximately 5 seconds to complete a lane switch (semanticscholar.org), and taking one's eyes off the road long enough to read a text message takes the same amount of time (cdc.gov). That's enough time to cover a football field at 55mph. If the child is considered to be distracted for more than five consecutive seconds, then they are given one strike. After the child gains three strikes, a text message is sent to their parent using Twilio letting them know that their child has been quite distracted while driving. The parent can choose to reply to that automated alert in order to further action. In addition to this, the parent will be able to access an online portal with information including real-time coordinates of the child, real-time location-accurate weather, and (WHAT ELSE).

Accomplishments that we're proud of

Our team is proud of our collaboration, critical thinking, ingenuity, and the final product. Each one of us has a different technical background and expertise, and we were able to find a way to include everyone's expertise and work together through difficult challenges in order to create an attention monitoring system that tracks when a user is distracted while driving/flying/operating.

What we learned

Our team learned that coming across annoying challenges and bugs are typical to the development process. In addition to this, we expanded our experience in developing with APIs, Django, Geolocation, and SQL.

Best Beginner Hack,Virtual Xylophone with Gesture Control over the cloud,https://hackcuv.devpost.com/submissions/113920-virtual-xylophone-with-gesture-control-over-the-cloud,"Inspiration

We were inspired by the need to play any instrument over the internet with a very good quality audio. Playing through Audio or Video call can lose the original quality. 

What it does

It detected the touch of the notes and sends the data of which note has been touched. This data is being used to reproduce the sound on the speaker using python script.
Also a gesture control system is integrated which give control of whether to record the song being played and also gives control when it has to be replayed

How we built it

We used three photon boards. 

Virtual Xylophone system:
This employs a photon board and it detects the note touches as data to the End user. This data is transferred over the internet which enables any number of end user to listen to the music. Any number of users can listen by subscribing to the channel

Gesture Control System:
This employs a leap motion sensor and a photon board. 
The gestures inputs help to record or playback the song recorded.
The photon board is used to transfer the gesture command over the cloud

User Speaker system:
This employs a photon board and runs a Python scripts.
The photon board receives the cloud data and produces the sound of the notes corresponding to the data received from the virtual xylophone system. The Python scripts helps in produces the sound of the notes and also to record or replay the music based on the commands received from the gesture control system

All the individual systems communicate over the cloud

Twisted hackers,BlockStory,https://hackcuv.devpost.com/submissions/113921-blockstory,"Inspiration

We wanted to try something completely new, and decided on trying to build a decentralized application. With this, we wanted to build a platform where users collaborate to make something special, all the while keeping the contributions secure and from verified sources, and to avoid spamming and profanity. 

What it does

BlockStory is a collaborative storytelling platform, where users can use their Ethereum to create new stories or contribute to existing ones, in order to create special and secure stories, free of spam, profanity, and from verified sources. The fee allows the smart contract transactions to be mined and verified before being added to the blockchain. This platform could be expanded to a wide variety of collaborative mediums.

How we built it

The project was built using Smart Contracts with Solidity, on the Ethereum Blockchain. We used the Truffle framework for the Smart Contracts. A local blockchain is hosted with Ganache, creating fake accounts with large amounts of Ethereum for testing, and Metamask for routing the Smart Contract transaction requests to the Ganache server. The frontend was built with React.js and Semantic UI.

Challenges we ran into

Since this was our first time using Blockchain technology, we ran into challenges with setting up Truffle, Ganache, and Metamask. Since string manipulation isn't included in Solidity, we needed to find ways to check the texts for profanity, which was another challenge. Finally, we ran into issues linking the React frontend with the Smart Contracts.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

We're proud of finishing a Blockchain project that is functional during the hackathon, having known barely anything about the technology before the event. 

What we learned

We learned about Smart Contracts, the Ethereum Blockchain, Solidity, Truffle, Ganache and Metamask.

What's next for BlockStory

Adding validation from external sources such as text analysis would improve on our current text analysis in the Smart Contract for the stories.  A voting system to approve and validate bits of text into the stories would make the entire platform more collaborative as well. We can also expand it to different forms of media or things to validate such as collaborative HTML/CSS code.

The biggest challenge is certainly the design elements of this project. Making an educational game is very different than simply making a game. It was difficult to try to think about all the needs of our targeted demographic. Trying to convey informational in a more graphical way was also very challenging as we have to also consider how can we make the material more engaging. We have to keep our attention on the targeted audience not what convinence for the programmers. 

We are not very experienced with GameMaker application nor do we have much art/ graphical ability so this is a very new experience for us.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud of a concept that was able to utilize everyone's skill set and target audience-centric and we also happy to be able to create a working prototype from software than we have never used before. 

What we learned

As much as technical skills are important it is only as good as the idea that you can generate. Although the demo was not constructed of very complex algorithms or technologies, we put a lot of energy into researching the targeted audience and how to better convey high-level concepts in a way that everyone can understand. From experience, the high school crowd is not the easiest to please. 

What's next for Unhackable - The Cyber Security Learning Game

To complete one fully complete module that is classroom ready.

Best Beginner Hack,Unhackable: Cyber Security Learning Platform Concept,https://hackcuv.devpost.com/submissions/113922-unhackable-cyber-security-learning-platform-concept,"Inspiration

Due to a shortage of cybersecurity talents, we aim to find a solution to get the next generation to learn about the relevancy of cybersecurity threat in their daily life and in the world around them in order to inspire the want to pursue a career in cybersecurity particularly those students in disctrict that may not previously have the opportunity to learn this topic.

What it does

Unhackable is a concept for a platform for students and educators to access interactive learning content regarding cybersecurity concepts. Educators will be able to access lesson plan and instructional materials to aid their teaching. Students and access interactive learning modules which serve as learning material and learning incentive.

Best Beginner Hack,Reactstrap Playground,https://hackcuv.devpost.com/submissions/113923-reactstrap-playground,"Inspiration

We were originally wanting to do something with RapidAPI, but could not get that working in time, so we pivoted and created a little tutorial/guide through some of the features of react.

What it does

This webpage contains a few tools for someone to ""customize"" their React webpage, including a slider for heading size and a color wheel to choose their background color.  Each of these features also updates real-time to show what code the user would have to write to achieve the same outcome.

How we built it

We started from scratch using react's create-app, and built in dynamic and static features by hand from the ground up.

Challenges we ran into

Since we pivoted a bit late into the hackathon, we scrambled for a bit trying to come up with an alternative idea.  Also, Javascript and React had their own challenges for us, since we are mostly novice coders.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

We actively communicated and pushed our work through GitHub without breaking anything.  We finished with a product we are generally proud of generating in roughly 15 hours.  This project could be expanded into many industries and the concepts could be reused for other programs.

What we learned

24 hours is not a lot of time.  Communication is paramount to success.  Having an idea coming into a project does not mean it will stay.  Versatility is easier to say than accomplish.

What's next for Reactstrap Playground

Unfortunately, this hackathon might have to be the lifespan for this project, as we are all busy in our schooling and career searches.

Best use of Twitter API,Mocking Bird,https://hackcuv.devpost.com/submissions/113924-mocking-bird,"Inspiration

We wanted to build something that lets companies use social media to improve their products and attract more potential investors.

What it does

Users type any search item in box and the app summarizes people's sentiment towards this topic in live stream mode. This is mainly geared towards public relations officers that want to analyze people's sentiment towards their company in real time. 

How we built it

The frontend part of app uses Java. The backend is written in Python and uses Tweepy (python wrapper for Twitter API) and text sentiment analysis method api. We collect 20 tweets in real time, and then run sentiment analysis for all the tweets. Then the interface shows the summary in a user friendly way.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

We were able to learn and effectively use APIs within just a few hours of the hackathon. 

What I learned

We learned how to work together as a team. We also learned to use APIs that we had no idea existed a couple of days ago!

What's next for Mocking Bird

1) Letting users collect tweets within a certain time interval to see changes in public perception.

2) Adding visual aspect to the summarization part.

3) Enable voice commands for topic searching.

Cyber Snake

2. Summary

The Elevator Pitch
This game will make a 10-13 years old kid play for hours having fun while he is learning basic cyber security aspects. Nothing is what it seems to be on real Internet 

Theme/Genre
Modern arcade game

Audience
10-13 years old kids

Game Flow Summary
Cyber Snake is a brilliant endless arcade game in which you take control of a snake. Your snake can only hit the objects that corresponds to the answer of the question game. When a correct object is hit, the user will earn 5 points. Those are the different types of challenges while playing:
Cryptography: A word is said to the user. If the word to encrypt is , the user must hit those word objects that its letters are in the right in the alphabet. Like  for . So, any “d” is transformed to an “e” and any a is transformed to “b”:
  ABCDEFG
  |     |
   ABCDEFG 

In order to be easy at the beginning we could use two letter that are very close together in the alphabet. As difficult is the lever, the difficulty can increase by adding more letters, more displacement and larger words.

Passwords: Word objects appear with passwords in it.User must avoid easy-to-hack passwords such as “hello” “12345” “catsandogs”, and hit the objects with difficult passwords. Difficult passwords of each level will be:
Easy: Those that have lower and capital letters.
Medium: Those that have numbers and lower and capital letters.
Easy: Those that have numbers, lower and capital letters and special characters

Authentication: It will be shown an emoji. Then, the user will have to avoid all the emojis that are not that one, and catch the one. 

An increase to the difficulty, we could ask security questions to the user, 4 responses could be provided as 4 objects and the user cannot avoid not hitting any of them. Two security questions could be asked:
What was your last score?
What was your highest score?

Back-up data: Used as a checkpoint. If you don’t catch the back-up data object a message will be shown, notifying that the user that data can be lost in case of emergency, or a Game Over. In the case the user hits the Back-up data object and then he dies, he will restart the game in the last Back-up data object hitted. So he doesn’t have to start from the beginning. 
Firewall (not designed): Two types of emojis will approach the user. One of them will be a “known access” and the other one a “not-known access”.

3. Educational Design

Learning Objectives
Every time the user makes a  bad decision, we explain them why it was a bad decision and so we explain them the cyber security theory behind that game mode. This theory difficulty and completeness of the method will increase when the level of the game is higher.

This theory will include the following points:
Cryptography
Difficult password generator
Authentication
General Cyber Hygiene: Back up data
Firewall

Puzzle/Challenge Structure
Every time the user completes a level, the difficulty increases and the feedback given is even more complex.

The main idea is to start with very basic cyber security concepts at the beginning levels and make them more difficult once the player reaches higher levels.

Play Flow
Images to explain the play flow

4. Storyline

Setting
They user will be able to select between Easy, Medium and Advance levels.

Apart of increasing the difficulty of the levels, the snake will move faster so the user will have less time to think about the correct solution.

Another setting is that the user can choose to play any random mode of game or to select an specific one. 

Characters
The main character is a “snake” which will be the one that the user will control. 

5. Game Play Mechanics

Controls
The snake will move Left/Right as the user scrolls his finger left/right the screen.

(not designed) There are going to be some levels where the user will have to “kill” some bad guys shooting balls.

Levels
For the MVP  the user could select between Easy, Medium and Advanced. And select a random game of mode or an specific one. 

For the next iteration, there could be an “infinite” number of levels. Starting at level 0 where the cyber security knowledge will be very basic, every time the user finishes a level, the difficulty of the challenges will increase, the learning feedback will have more technical aspects and the snake’s speed will increase so the user will have a shorter time to think.

Technical Requirements:  AI, Art Assets
It will be implemented with 2-D Unity. No AI needed, just easy programming skills on Game development. Art Assets may be needed to increment user experience. UI is very important for kids to get engaged on the game. 

It is known that 10-year-old kids focusing is not stable, so it will have to be implemented colorful and with trendy music played on. 

6. Scoring Method

For the MVP, in the main screen appears the last score and the highest score for the game of mode selected in the Settings.

For the next iteration, as we will have levels the score will increase proportionally to the number of levels the user survives playing. The further you get, the more points you have. If some “missions” are completed, such as catching the correct words, some points will be awarded too.

There will be a global ranking and a friends ranking. This will engage the user to keep playing until they reach the top of the ranking. You can connect with facebook, instagram and phone book numbers (as kids of this age may not have an account to those social networks), so friends competing will be one of the main points on kids to be engaged.

THE PACKAGE PROTECTOR

Use Protection™

Ever had an expensive package destroyed in the mail? Probably. It's happened to all of us at some point.

But now, with the advent of inexpensive microcomputers like Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and Qualcomm Dragonbard 410c, companies can provide a near-omniscient view of your package from the moment it leaves the warehouse to the moment it shows up at your door.

In the future, you can log in to a website and get minute by minute updates on your package's condition, but for now, we're using Twilio's API's to send you critical information as it occurs and Rapid's APIs to give you premium access to maps so you can check the exact location of your important goods.

To prove we're the best, we check our data against UPS, DHL, FedEx, and USPS, and with the ability to get detailed statistics about your order delivered direct to your phone, filing damaged or lost package claims is dead easy.

The microcomputer will come stocked with a variety of sensors including:


GPS for accurate tracking of your package. Out with tracking numbers and in with real-time updates
Accelerometer to let you know if your fragile package had and unexpected bumps or bruises in transit
Water sensor in case of the unfortunate event of dropping your package in the ocean


We care deeply about your package, and you should too. There's no better way to ensure your package is insured and lives up to the high shipping costs you pay.

Best Hardware Hack
Best hack using hardware.


Dish Device Tracker
Track an object (thing) as it moves through any points on the CU Campus, visualize or display the data in a meaningful way, solve a consumer pain-point or create some additional value for society.


Splunk Challenge
The team who processes and makes sense of the most unstructured data will win!


MLH: Best IoT Hack using a Qualcomm Device
Use a Qualcomm device, like the Dragonboard 410C, in your IoT project.


Rapid API
use 2 or more APIs through the RapidAPI platform. It can be any of the 8,000+ APIs on the marketplace, the more APIs you use the better! Bonus points for creating and exposing your API publicly or privately using RapidAPI to add authentication, billing, analytics, and more. Important URLS: docs.rapidql.com, docs.rapidapi.com, provider.rapidapi.com.


Twilio
combining various of our own APIs, use our APIs in ways we haven’t seen before or by solving a great problem with them



THE PACKAGE PROTECTOR

Use Protection™

Ever had an expensive package destroyed in the mail? Probably. It's happened to all of us at some point.

But now, with the advent of inexpensive microcomputers like Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and Qualcomm Dragonbard 410c, companies can provide a near-omniscient view of your package from the moment it leaves the warehouse to the moment it shows up at your door.

In the future, you can log in to a website and get minute by minute updates on your package's condition, but for now, we're using Twilio's API's to send you critical information as it occurs and Rapid's APIs to give you premium access to maps so you can check the exact location of your important goods.

To prove we're the best, we check our data against UPS, DHL, FedEx, and USPS, and with the ability to get detailed statistics about your order delivered direct to your phone, filing damaged or lost package claims is dead easy.

The microcomputer will come stocked with a variety of sensors including:


GPS for accurate tracking of your package. Out with tracking numbers and in with real-time updates
Accelerometer to let you know if your fragile package had and unexpected bumps or bruises in transit
Water sensor in case of the unfortunate event of dropping your package in the ocean

Coolest Hack with Twilio,HitMemeUp,https://hackcuv.devpost.com/submissions/113927-hitmemeup,"Inspiration

We wanted a handy way to get memes (like giphys on slack) and we decided the most convenient way to do this would be to send query to a server over text and receive images/gifs back.

What it does

It is very simple, text a query for an imgur image, receive a random image that matches that query.

How we built it

We used a flask backend in a docker container on a remote server to handle requests from Twilio and retrieve image URLs from Imgur.

Challenges we ran into

Coming up with a valid idea was a challenge, we wanted a project we could finish and something that would be interesting and useful; hence the simplicity. In terms of actual development, we had issues retrieving some images because they where embedded in an album of one image. In order for the app to actually send images, as opposed to links to images, we had to dig through the Imgur api and combine a few api calls in order to retrieve the image URL.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

Going from concept to ""finished"" project. I think its easy to come up with a big grand idea and after 24 hours have that cut back to the bare working minimum. 

What we learned

We learned how to use Twilio and how powerful it can be. We also learned how to take our vague idea and polish it out.

What's next for HitMemeUp

We would like to expand it so we can send memes to other people and also pull memes from other sources.

Coolest Hack with Twilio,BillHub,https://hackcuv.devpost.com/submissions/113930-billhub,"Inspiration

I wanted to stay more up to date with current US legislation and bill proposals.

What it does

BillHub allows users to identify which representatives views align with their values the most and allows them to follow legislation that may affect their everyday lives.

How we built it

We built the web app utilizing the MERN stack with a responsive frontend.

Challenges we ran into

Data transfer to/from MongoDB and working with varying API data structures.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

Big Data Analytics: Non-Obvious Web Traffic,Data-Mining Clickstreams,https://hackcuv.devpost.com/submissions/113932-data-mining-clickstreams,"Inspiration

We had an interest in data science, and Oppenheimer Funds had a large set of data that needed analyzing.  

What it does

The project attempts to organize seemingly unrelated clickstream data into a group of clusters that should cover roughly 80% of web traffic to oppenheimerfunds.com  

How we built it

We used python and Unix terminal commands to break down the data into smaller groups that were then funnelled into the Google Cloud platform to produce graphs.  

Challenges we ran into

The data sets produced graphs that were too complex to be generated on a local machine. We needed to utilize the computing provided by Google's Cloud computing to generate some of the graphs.  

Accomplishments that we're proud of

We succeeded to graph a number of the data sets we produced.  

What we learned

Never try to export a directed graph with 3 million nodes to a .dot file locally.
Gained a much greater familiarity with graphing packages in Python.  

What's next for Data-Mining Clickstreams

Due to the results we achieved, no future projects are planned. The conclusions we have drawn may be used to potentially reshape the current Oppenheimer website, however that is the extent of the usefulness of our findings.
